  imagine. We do not have a lot of expendible income and so we are asking fo

 day the 6th and we expect them to admit her at that time for tests prior to
  a surgery that may have her in the hospital for a week or more likely\, 4-
 6 weeks with recovery after that before flying home to Boise. \nWe are tech
