 id Smith and send him a message like "You are so smart!"\n\nCrystal:\nI sup
 pose!\nMe:\nYes!  It's working!\n\nCrystal:\nThat's silly\nIs it though?  I
 s it really though?\n\nCrystal:\nTo me\, yes\nMe:\nlol\, it is silly to me 
 too.  But I have always acted like a child on the internet.  This is just a
  test\, and you are helping.\n\nCrystal:\nAll I said was "hi" to Travis\nMe
 :\nAww\, not enough\, tell him he looks smart today.\nIf this works it will
  be a hilarious inside joke.\nImagine you aren't the only person that is go
 ing to tell him that right now.\nlol\nI'll send you the results.\nlol\n\nCr
 ystal:\nToo silly\, I refuse\nMe:\nAww come on!\nYou think its silly becaus
 e you know the truth\nTravis is going to think what?\n\nCrystal:\n"well tha
 t was weird and out of the blue"\n"must be doing one of those 'I'm going to
  give out hardly thoughtful compliments to make me and the world feel bette

 Me:\nlol cynic.\n\nTUE 5:53PM\nMe:\nWe should do Joe Flieger next.\n\nCryst
 al:\nNo\, that would be silly\nMe:\nWill you send him a compliment?\n\nCrys
 tal:\nNo that would be silly\nMe:\nStinker 😛\n\nCrystal:\nSure\n\nMe:\n9:0
 6AM\nAre you still afraid of being silly and looking people straight in the
  eyes?\n\nCrystal:\nIm not afraid of being silly\nand I am still\, though m
 ust less so\, afraid of looking people straight in the eyes.\nMe:\nHmmm.  I
  wonder if these are related 😛\n\nCrystal:\nI dont think they are\nok\nMe:
 \nCan't give someone a compliment?  Who are you right now?\n\nCrystal:\nI d
 ont give people compliments just for the sake of giving them a compliment. 
 It's not very genuine.\nMe:\nI think you don't give enough people complimen
 ts in general.  I also think you can't take a compliment\, because I asked 
 40 other people to give a compliment\, you are the only person that said No
 .  1 other person cried because she has a problem with worrying and she is 
 crazy.  2 out of 40 was my success rate\, you are a mathematician\, what is
  your rate of success?\n\nCrystal:\nIt's not my personality to give complim
 ents. I'm not going to give an out-of-the-blue ingenuine one just because s
 omeone tells me to.\nMe:\nCan you do anything people tell you to?\n\nCrysta
 l:\nIf I feel it makes sense to\, sure\nMe:\nGod tells you to give complime
 nts.\n\nCrystal:\nHe does?\nI'll pass\nMe:\nYou're passing on God's word?  
 You should talk to your husband about that 😉\n\nCrystal:\nI dont think God
  tells me to give compliments\nAnd if he does\, then yes\, I'll pass\n\nCry
 stal:\nBecause he\, of all people\, would understand\nMe:\nI think this is 
 a sign why you have a problem with religion.  Here is proof  http://bible.k
 nowing-jesus.com/topics/Compliments\n15 Bible verses about Compliments\nA t
 opical Bible which shows the most relevant Bible verse for each topic\nbibl
 e.knowing-jesus.com\nAct like God and you will feel more like him.\n\n\nCry
 stal:\nuh... "He who rebukes a man will afterward find more favor Than he w
 ho flatters with the tongue." "A lying tongue hates those it crushes\, And 
 a flattering mouth works ruin."\nbut anyway\, I dont think God commands us 
 to compliment. thats not what any of these verses are saying.\nCommandment 
 #11 "thou shalt compliment thy friend each day"\nMe:\nTo me your are Perfec
 t. ❤\n\nCrystal:\ngross\nMe:\nYou just made a commandment\, who else can do
  that?\n\nCrystal:\nAlright\, Love Actually.\nMe:\nSpread the love sister!\

 .\n\nMy pleasure\, thanks for reaching out. I don't think there's a technic
 al definition of genius from a neuroscience perspective. The mechanisms are
 n't fully understood. But it also depends on what you mean by the terms\, b
 ecause sometimes people apply it to intelligence\, but other times it refer
 s to creativity in general. My colleague Dr. Robert Bilder is running an fM
 RI study trying to understand what makes extremely creative people differen

  10 books because I didn't want to be wasteful.\nWent to post office to che

 ought he put it at the wrong mailbox or it got sent back to warehouse.\nOrd

  after it was "delivered".\nCoincidence or the universe supporting my ambit

 up to have the confidence that my package was not going to arrive.  As soon
  as I express myself politely\, I am sent twice as many copies of the book.
 \nWhy not yesterday?  Why not tomorrow?  Why right after I order a replacem

DESCRIPTION:\nAutism awareness day\, April 2nd 2018\n\nTL\;DR - Facebook fr
 iends are people who turn on you instantaneously when they see something th
 ey don't like on yours or their wall.\n\nI would like to take a moment to e
 xplain what Autism or rather Aspergers means to me.\n\nEarly childhood.  Wh
 en I was a baby\, my mother and father separated.  For many different reaso
 ns\, but in the interest of breaking the cycle\, I believe asperges's has a
  lot to do with it.  My parents never had the benefit of these "labels" we 
 put on people.  I never knew what it feels like to have parents that passio
 nately love each other.  By everyone's standards\, this made me very specia
 l.  I was showered with love from a now distant family\, I was single out a
 nd held in special counseling sessions in elementary school where a counsel
 or would interrogate me on all kinds of issues.  I was also excluded from a
 dvanced reading\, mathematics\, and honors\, a practice in modern education
  that I have come to absolutely despise.\n\nWhen I was young\, my mother to
 ok me to see a specialist to diagnose me with ADD.  After that\, my sugar i
 n take and diet was closely monitored.  I was prescribed Ritalin and later 
 Adderral.  Another practice that is pushed in to your minds by pharmaceutic
 al companies.  Another common practice that I have come to absolutely despi
 se.  As it turns out\, education is boring\, my eyes shake more than usual\
 , which causes any fly to distract me and for me to lose focus.\n\nI have a
 lways found people to be extremely un-relatable.  I think stupidity is anno
 ying.  I think scatter-brained-ness is annoying.  I think yelling\, itching
 \, stinking\, sitting\, clothing\, eating\, peas\, lima beans\, overcooked 
 food\, clocks ticking\, fans spinning\, sweating\, socks\, alarms\, bells a
 re all ANNOYING!  People who think they are smarter than me.  "You aren't s
 marter than me\, get over yourself. Fuck you."  People who are dismissive o
 f my feelings because they don't understand them and I don't know how to ex
 press them properly.\n\nThe worst annoyance that stands out in my mind grow
 ing up is sharing a space with brothers.  I was the oldest\, and therefore 
 I was expected to set a good example.  I was expected to share my toys\, my
  computer\, my mother\, my games\, my space\, my couch with your smelly fee
 t\, MY EARS! MY MOTHER.  You can imagine all the other piddly stuff every p
 arent can imagine that matters next to nothing when you are over the age of
  15.\n\nWhen I was 15\, I was considered a "late bloomer".  I was small\, a
 nd extremely ANNOYING!  I survived years of misunderstanding social interac
 tions\, and being bullied by kids in school\, and both by father and step-f
 ather.  I realized I had turned in to exactly that which I despised.  I was
  a pest.  I definitely wasn't good at any sports because I didn't know what
  it meant to work on a team.  I missed out on all the important parts of so
 cializing\, Aspergers to me is a failure to recognize certain details of so
 cial interaction\, these details:\n\n* If you have something\, and your fri
 end really needs it\, you should give it to them.\n* When you visit someone
  you should bring a small token of appreciation.\n* When someone comes to s
 ee you\, you should offer something to drink.\n* Don't assume people don't 
 like you\, people like you and things you say are interesting.\n* Always be
  honest.\n\nThese things stand out as being absolutely essential to the dev
 elopment of a strong persona.  I realized too late that I hated these exper
 iences because I didn't understand them.  I now know its important for my d
 evelopment:\n\n* School - I continue to this day to desire more schooling a
 nd learn new things often\n* Soccer\, Basketball\, Track and field\, Workin
 g out\, Sports of any kind\, Physical education of every kind\n* Being on a
  team - Scouts I quit to soon\, following the social niceties listed above 
 in school and higher education\n* Being a team player - At work\, do as you
 r asked\, listen to what people say (to be determined)\n* Staying organized
  - Cleanliness is next to godliness.  Use a calendar for TODOs\n* Family - 
 Brothers\, cousins\, sisters\, aunts\, uncles\n\n<insert google search of d
 ealing with Aspergers>\n\nI grew up/am still growing up being told that I w
 ill be successful\, and not believing it.  I didn't realize that I had Aspe
 rgers until multiple people who I trust told me that it is very obvious to 
 them.  @Mary Mueritzen used the little building blocks logo for our team at
  @CharlesSchwab.  My best friend @Aneesh also identified my personality dis
 advantages.  Now that I realize I have certain triggers\, I can't begin to 
 diffuse my anger and frustration\, instead of taking it out on the people I
  love.  There are still some days I feel out of control\, and I have a gene
 ral troll type attitude towards social networks.  Aspergers for me is some 
 days waking up and feeling itchy in your own skin.\n\n\n\n\n\n

DESCRIPTION:Why we should stop using the word troll to describe people.\n\n
 TLDR\; This word is in itself offensive to call someone\, therefore the per
 son calling another person a troll becomes the troll.\n\nUsing the word tro
 ll freely to describe a person who breaks your perceived set of rules is a 
 toxic idea and here is why:\n\nUsing the word troll brands the industry wit
 h a certain expectation: follow our community guidelines or you will be lab
 elled a troll and no one will care to listen to you.\n\nWe've already decid
 ed in our heads that a specific set of guild-lines are rules that everyone 
 can and should follow.  The purpose for rules is to keep people from fallin
 g short of our expectations of acceptable human behavior.  But there is a b
 iological deficiency to meeting people's expectations 100% of the time.  Th
 is biological deficiency is a chemically induced emotional response located
  in the limbic system of the brain.  Programmers spend enough time on the c
 omputer already\, they don't need another reason to act like a robot.\n\nIf
  you want a society of emotionless robots\, we can continue down this path.
   As an industry that is under the micro-scope for discrimination\, there a
 re plenty of example where emotions take part in logical argument.  But for
  some reason the tech industry is at the forefront of the idea that emotion
 s have no place in logical arguments.  I beg you to consider that this phil
 osophy is flawed\, for it is emotions that make us human\, it is ambition t
 hat makes us want to improve other people's lives through the use of techno
 logy\, and it is emotion that drives ambition.\n\nThe reason I want to viol
 ate your guild-lines is simple.  I want better guild-lines and better rules
 .  We try to think of our legal system as something that changes and evolve
 s all the time\, this is because people violate the rules of the legal syst
 em.  When enough people violate the rules\, either the rules must change\, 
 or the people must change through hardship imposed by the system.\n\nWhat h
 ardship do community guild-lines place on the community?  What stress does 
 the community place on the guild-lines?\nI'll attempt to answer this throug
 h 1 concrete example and hopefully I can extract more over time with other 
 people's feedback.\n\nThe most common example that I see is administrating 
 support issues.  Often people may enter a support request from a search eng
 ine\, or being a new user who is unfamiliar with the community.  Just like 
 any on-boarding process\, there is an administrative cost.  A new person co
 mes in and needs guidance.  They can read the rules\, they can read the con
 tributing rules\, and still be lost.  It is a lot of work to create a forum
  and list of related topics or tags\, it would be impossible to expect ever
 y administrator to document every topic\, however the expectations of the g
 uidelines dictate that every new-comer must stay on-topic or be labelled un
 helpful and off-topic\, creating more administration.\n\nNow we have a dile
 mma.  Forum administrators lack perfect documentation and have the expectat
 ion of perfect compliance.  New-comers lack perfect documentation and have 
 the fear of being out-caste by administrators.  I realize this scenario sou
 nd extreme\, but it so common it is endemic across the entire industry.  Gi
 tHub\, StackOverflow\, Google\, Oracle\, Microsoft\, these companies perpet
 uate intolerance by expecting perfect tolerance.  Here are concrete example
 s of how this plays out in a less extreme diplomatic way:\n\n1) copy exampl
 e from GitHub\n2) copy example from Oracle\n3) copy example from StackOverf
 low\n4) filing a bug report with Microsoft is next to impossible and cost m
 oney\n\nThe sad part of all of this is\, I find these victims of troll sham
 ing (pop-culture buzz-words) to actually be valuable contributors.  Their c
 ontributions are completely overlooked by administrative busywork.  Who dec
 ided that issues need to be filed?  Who designed a bug tracking program to 
 use tags instead of automatically matching keywords?   Who decides you need
  150 points to participate on SO instead of only 15?  Obviously it is SO's 
 decision\, but that just show's their own elitism and inability to question
  what is valuable and what is not.\n\nYour determination of what is valuabl
 e conversation is not the point or necessary.  What is necessary is that yo
 u question what is valuable.  The question is important\, not the answer.  
 It is the question that exemplifies forethought\, consideration\, and even 
 some compassion for the stereo-typical troll that separates you from the tr
 oll.\n\nUsing administrative busy-work as a basis for poor conversation mak
 es you the troll\, not the person who is posting off topic.  "Communication
  is key" was a phrase taught to me over and over and I believe it to be cri
 tical to the survival of not just our industry\, but also our own humanity.
   My dream is that we drop all community guide-lines because we don't need 
 them and we don't need to discard people's emotions by banning/referring th
 em to the guide-lines.\n\nAnd with that\, I leave you with one final reques
 t.  Next time you encounter a troll or something off-topic\, respond with a
  question instead of a label/stereo-type.  Because I care:\nDo you have any
  questions and is this article clear and understandable?\n\n\n

 e of all the companies\, never got an email\n20) Work isn't fulfilling\, do
 n't feel needed\n21) In 6 months only had 10 lines of code actually used by
  someone in production\n22) Teammates aren't friendly\, invited me out once
  in 6 months\n23) Too many layers of management between developers and busi
 ness needs\n24) No direction for development\n25) Fuck test driven design\n
 26) Fuck agile\, usual pitfalls\, people lie in standup meetings and about 
 progress because of no accountability\n27) Everyone asks about timeline\, b
 ut aggregate output on velocity from Version1 is meaningless or completely 
 unused\n28) Afraid to change or develop new patterns\n29) Brent is possessi
 ve over his project\, told me he was concerned about switching things up\, 
 too afraid to go directly to Phil and Jeff\n30) Too afraid to be honest wit
 h Phil and Jeff because they are afraid of conflict\n31) Leadership opportu
 nities could take another year or two to fund\n32) No leadership opportunit
 ies because positions are filled\n33) Afraid and reluctant to learn and cre
 ate new coding patterns\n34) No social login integration\n35) Moves too slo

  saving the company money with no change\n36) Tim doesn't like people using
  their personal computers but 2 other members on my team do it anyways\n37)
  Failed to help me understand the big picture\, is the point of all busines
 s just to help others be more comfortable?\n38) No option to work remote ev
 en though other people do\n39) Phil squashed my commits when I first starte
 d\, I've never squashed someone else's work\n40) Didn't follow through on t
 he squash and clean up the rest of the repository\, despite handing over th
 e instructions\n41) Didn't let me clean up the repository because of some b
 ullshit politics around the repo\n42) No follow through\n\n

DESCRIPTION:+1 614-361-7192\nI like the way you think. Lol. I suppose it ha
 s something to do with you being blood. \nThere's so much to comment on her
 e. What I will say is I agree that everyone has already done or thought of 
 everything. It's all in the execution. I marvel at how start ups get tracti
 on on simplistic ideas. Much like people marvel at my success designing bet
 ter products and actually making things. To me it's easy. To others it's my
 stical. \nThe article on copying is excellent. The road to success is build
 ing on the past. Making it better. There are very few truly new ideas\, but
  lots of improved ideas. I am fortunate enough to have come up with a few o
 f the new ideas. They are not as widely accepted as an iPhone\, but you don
 't have to score that big to do very well in life. \nOne of your ideas is a
 lmost exactly what Vistage does. Look at the Vistage website. They have wha
 t they call resources. Experts in various fields who come into our companie
 s and train us CEO's for 4 hours\, once a month. Then you can hire these sa
 me guys to come back and train your staff if you think it's a fit. They get
  about 3\,000 for the 4 hours so your numbers are a bit low.\n\nWhat is you
 r topic?\nAlmost all of the speakers have companies specializing in what th
 ey teach. I'll send you a few so you can see what I mean. They have a fairl
 y structured 3 hour presentation. I'd be curious to know what you'd talk ab
 out for 3 hours. \nI'm sure you have plenty to say\, don't get me wrong. I 
 just would like to know what you're thinking. \nBrian Cullinan\nI'm speakin
 g about the importance of education and employee development.  My company b
 ehind it is studysauce.com.\nTaking management classes on lynda.com\n+1 614
 -361-7192\nI'm still not sure how study sauce works. It's not clear to firs
 t time viewers of the webpage. I recall looking at the app a long time ago.
  Maybe it wasn't done yet. Anyway\, how does it know what you've learned in
  order to remind you before you forget?\nBrian Cullinan\nSpecifically this 
 idea of interleaving disciplines.  It can be used to increase productivity\
 , and keep employees interested in their task.  It is often overlooked beca
 use once you have something stable\, managers "don't want to distract peopl
 e".  But that is anti-progressive to it's core.  By giving people different
  tasks and projects\, you can retain them longer and make them more excited
  about the work.\nIt knows what you learned from previous answers.  This is
  the only piece of IP that is implemented and Stephen has a new patent out 
 on how to implement it in an app: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forgetting_
 curve\n+1 614-361-7192\nThe necessary number of people needing to learn com
 plex thought is decreasing rapidly. It won't be long before robots will be 
 making everything and jobs will be lost and people need to learn new skills
 . Like how to clean up robot poop. \nBrian Cullinan\nRight.  There will be 
 lots of robot poop.  But people who are stuck in the same position and don'
 t care about learning new things will find themselves unfulfilled when surr
 ounded with automation.  I aim to fix this\, by delicately forcing employee
 s to do something different.\nWednesday\, September 20\, 2017 8:03 AM\nBria
 n Cullinan\nIs my boss having the position that I want a good enough reason
  to seek out that position somewhere else?\nWednesday\, September 27\, 2017
  2:05 PM\nBrian Cullinan\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/27/magazine/when-
 not-guilty-is-a-life-sentence.html\nWednesday\, September 27\, 2017 5:05 PM
 \nBrian Cullinan\nYou know what we should do with those old MG Midgets?  Tu
 rn them into self driving photo taking cars and sell them for 1 mil each.  
 I have the technology. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhcWjq7JSjo\n+1 614-
 361-7192\nTo answer your earlier question\, the vast majority of people loo
 king for a new job want their bosses or even their bosses job. It's up to y
 ou if you think you can find it. But you may not like it once you get it. T
 he higher you go the more political you need to become. Corporate politics 
 I mean. \nBrian Cullinan\nWould a tech company pay $1mil for self driving c
 ar R&D?\nThursday\, September 28\, 2017 5:57 AM\n+1 614-361-7192\nYour ques
 tion is very open ended. If you're thinking that you have a self driving ca
 r technology breakthrough that a car company would be interested in buying\
 , that question is way over my head. \nThursday\, September 28\, 2017 9:45 
 AM\nBrian Cullinan\nI have a different approach to "big data" and "AI" that
  none of them will even consider because they are already "experts" in big 
 data and they can't see past their own shoe-laces. \n+1 614-361-7192\nHave 
 you considered starting small with your idea\, generating some customers wh
 o are willing to pay for your data? Then you build scale from there. But un
 til you have at least one customer you should not criticize those who have 
 customers. \nAnd once you have a customer\, get another one\, and another..
 ...\nFriday\, September 29\, 2017 1:52 PM\nBrian Cullinan\nThe CEO of equif
 ax is getting $90 million to retire: http://fortune.com/2017/09/26/equifax-
 ceo-richard-smith-net-worth/\nSomeone that has compromised the social secur
 ity of millions of Americans.  Who do you think works harder\, me or Richar

 you accomplish at least one of those tasks\, you can leave work feeling pro

DESCRIPTION:Thanks to Erika I finally realized what was happening after the
  retrospective.  I would like to see this item added.\n\nThere were two dis
 tinct events of scope creep in the last sprint.\n\n1) Changing the Portal 2
 .0 API\n8/24/2017 - All tests passing\, green light from QA - Erika\n9/12/2
 017 - Camel casing changes - Phil\n9/25/2017 - PageId Zuora credit card pos
 t - Brent\n10/4/2017 - Tax shouldn't return unless address is provided - Br
 ent\n\nThe last item is interesting because the current portal defaults to 
 the company's address to calculate tax.\n\n2) Eloqua import service archite
 cture\n9/21/2017 - Renewals fully unit tested and running on IIS\n9/25/2017
  - Microservices should be converted to .Net Core and lambda - Phil \n9/29/
 2017 - Eloqua bulk import combined with bigger effort to get Zuora data to 
 Eloqua - Drew\n10/3/2017 - Meeting with Xavier\, no access to current servi
 ce\, no follow-up meeting - X\n10/10/2017 - AWS extension for VS not workin
 g\n\nIn the middle of September Drew mentioned getting additional values ou
 t of Zuora.  Going into this had the impression this project would be separ
 ate from the other projects but the architecture would remain the same.\n\n
 In both of these situations design decisions were made after the task was a
 ssigned and given a complexity value.  I should try to realize when this ha
 ppens sooner going forward.\n\n

DESCRIPTION:Karma\, how it works (treat everyone as best you can now becaus
 e you may need them in the future):\n\nKarmic scenarios - A driver in his 6
 0 cuts off a woman in traffic\, 5 years later\, he has a heart attack while
  driving. The nurse taking care of him in the hospital that is changing his
  urine bag is the same woman he cut off. She is also having a stressful day
  because of traffic.\n\nThis scenario is entirely hypothetical and there ar
 e too many variables to measure. What is constant however\, is how awful tr
 affic is. Has anyone every thought that your car also has body language? Si
 milar to how humans have body language\, a car can be used to establish tru
 st or manipulate or express anger.\n\nHow do you establish trust with a car
 ? Easy\, follow the rules. Come to a complete stop. Use your blinker. Wave 
 people in front of you as if you were entering a public space and holding t
 he door for someone else.\n\nI love roundabouts because despite their chaot
 ic appearance\, they are actually highly coordinated. Everyone in a roundab
 out must be more courtesy of others.\n\n\n

DESCRIPTION:Oral health:<br><br>Mostly everything that goes into your stoma
 ch\, passes through your mouth first.&nbsp\; That means your mouth has the 
 enzymes that are carried further into your digestive system.&nbsp\; Doesn't
  it stand to reason\, that the health and state of these enzymes also affec
 t your overall health?<br>Angular:<br><br>Before I started with Angular\, I
  made the classic mistake of inventing my own framework.&nbsp\; I think at 
 least everyone should go through the experience of developing sometime "too
  rigid"\, so they can appreciate the technology stacks we have now.<br><br>
 I began by using angular-cli\, and that make my life a lot easier than tryi
 ng to configure webpack.&nbsp\; There is an emit option in angular-cli that
  makes it easy to revert to the classic mode of compiling with webpack.<br>
 <br>Node:<br><br>I love node\, and I think V8 is one of the coolest things 
 to happen to the web.&nbsp\; The reason is simple\, you can run the same co
 de on the client as you do on the server.&nbsp\; This sounds like a simple 
 statement\, but I think it has made codebases a lot smaller.<br><br>Docker:
 <br><br>I've used Docker every day for the past two years.&nbsp\; One probl
 em I run into sometimes is this //pipe/ error on Windows.&nbsp\; Reinstalli
 ng completely appears to help.<br><br>My favorite part about Docker is auto
 matically installing and configuring services.&nbsp\; A lot of software req
 uires a fairly comprehensive knowledge of how it works in order to use it.<
 br><br>I think this "anti-user-experience" thinking.&nbsp\; Software should
  require very little knowledge in order to use it properly.&nbsp\; Therefor
 e\, it should "just work" when I download and install it.<br><br>Docker abs
 tracts the complexities of downloading\, installing\, configuring\, and run
 ning.&nbsp\; Now to make use of something\, I typically just search for "&l
 t\;platform&gt\; docker" where &lt\;platform&gt\; is replaced by whatever t
 ask or technology I am trying to accomplish.<br><br><br>Firebase:<br><br>Fi
 rebase is awesome.&nbsp\; What I love about Firebase is the part where it r
 emoves the entire service layer.&nbsp\; It use to be\, I have my front-end\
 , my back-end\, and various services in between to check for things like ac
 cess control\, permissions\, aggregate data\, etc.<br><br>Pretty much every
  fields saved or interaction needed it needs validation on the front-end\, 
 validation in the service\, validation by the database.&nbsp\; Firebase giv
 es me real-time data\, with ACLs\, directly from the server to the client.&
 nbsp\; No services or authorization in between to get what you need to disp
 lay to the user.<br><br><br>Education in the workplace:<br><br>I feel knowl
 edgeable\, but no one around cares!&nbsp\; This pretty much encapsulates ev
 erything that is wrong with the workplace today.<br><br>I realized a while 
 ago\, with the help my father who is in the manufacturing business\;&nbsp\;
  I don't actually do anything.&nbsp\; I don't produce anything physical.&nb
 sp\; My labors can't be used or benefited from by other people.&nbsp\; If m
 y Github repository disappears there's literally nothing left of my existen
 ce.&nbsp\;&nbsp\;<br><br>Once I realized I this\, it lead me to realize\, i
 f I am not producing any output\, how can my performance possibly be measur
 ed with any sense of accuracy?&nbsp\; There is this idea in the corporate w
 orld that departments and costs and employees must be measured and evaluate
 d.<br><br>I hate employee evaluations.&nbsp\; The whole idea sounds idiotic
  to me.&nbsp\; If an employee wasn't doing what they were asked to do\, tel
 l them when it happens\, don't wait until the end of the year like a slap i
 n the face.&nbsp\; I've never really had a bad review\;&nbsp\; I gave a bad
  review to a company one time\, and I received a 50% raise because of it.<b

DESCRIPTION:\nBorder control (it's got bigger holes than you think):\nToday
  we bring to light a hot button issue.  Border control.\n\nAmerica is built
  on colonialist politics.  This idea that if we disagree with someone\, we 
 must start our own nation that is free to disagree with the same things the
  founders disagree with.  It seems\, even despite the momentum of industry 
 and science\, we still have these cold-war anti-communist anti-Russian feel
 ings towards our brothers overseas. \n\nScience has no borders.  The bounda
 ries are the ones we set on each test case.  Scientists don't care if you a
 re Russian or English or Black or Yellow.  All that matters in science is "
 Can you find me an answer faster?"\n\nThere are people in this world from c
 ountries such as Saudi Arabia\, Mexico\, Israel\, Iran\, who aren't happy e
 nough to grow up in their neighborhood\, marry their childhood friend\, and
  spend the rest of their lives living peacefully among people who also grew
  up in their country and plan to spend their entire lives living out their 
 days in that country.\n\nThere are also people that like to move around.  S
 ome people from other countries come to the US 8.5 months pregnant with the
  intention of having a child here\, getting a US passport for their newborn
  child\, and then using the advantages of a multi-national citizen to their
  own benefit (instead of the benefit of the country the citizenship comes f
 rom).  This is selfish.\n\nSome people do not come here because they believ
 e in the American ideal.  It is merely a means to an end.  Safety.  A backu
 p plan.  To get a leg up above someone else in their country of origin.  Or
  to educate themselves as a foreigner because their own country's education
 al system is corrupt.\n\nSee\, we can all argue whether or not Trump's wall
  is metaphorical or even possible.  The truth is\, no walls keep out ideas.
   The idea that being an American gives you advantages that are otherwise i
 mpossible.\n\nAmerica is still the only true path to freedom.\n\n\n

DESCRIPTION:Retirement:\n\nI will never afford to retire.  When I make this
  statement\, the knee-jerk response is "Well you could if you started plann
 ing now!"  "Go fuck yourself and your plans."  The misunderstanding between
  generations/me/society are sometimes bewildering.\n\nI will never afford m
 yself to retire my physical body\, mental health\, spiritual growth\, until
  my death.  This is the more verbose meaning of my statement.  I say it as 
 if it is something that can be afforded\; in order to get people to out the
 mselves as useless planners.\n\n\nI refuse to work hard my entire life to b
 e able to "enjoy" the last few years in retirement.  This ambition is impor
 tant\, this means life must be enjoyed the entire time\, not just as someth
 ing to look forward to.  This is not a plan\, this is a prison sentence for
  your mind.\n\nIf you won't give up on your precious retirement for the hea
 lth of the next generation\, what would cause you to give it up?  Economic 
 bankruptcy?  Would you give up retirement for climate change?  Would you gi
 ve up on retirement for human rights?\n\n

DESCRIPTION:Phil told me to take time off for my "mental health".\n\nPhil t
 old me we underestimate complexity and it makes our team's velocity look ba
 ck\, but then refuses to show me the number.\n\nPhil told me to get changes
  done and PRed before passing it on to QA because it "would save him money"
 .  But then QA comes and asks me for stuff to do because she's bored.\n\nPh
 il has zero control\, but also has the authority.  Bullshit.

DESCRIPTION:Pros:\n\nThe people are great.  There is a very open mode of co
 mmunication\, in stand up it's discussed which departments need to be invol
 ved on a project.  Managers take that information and communicate it to the
  other departments as needed\, but mostly the individual employee is respon
 sible and encouraged to manage all interdepartmental communications.  I see
  this as being a positive opposite of typical corporate America.\n\nThe com
 pany has interest in new technologies.  Engineers are welcome to use the la
 test build stack as long as it is one of the two they have picked out.\n\nC
 ons:\n\nLack of design and direction.  Requests are made from departments\,
  it's filtered through 3 layers of management\, and the engineer is expecte
 d to use Waterfall methodology.  The only thing Agile about the process her
 e is stand-up\, and that seems to be the pattern with companies that don't 
 know Agile.\n\nEmployees are encouraged by the company to "integrate" and "
 learn and share knowledge"\, but then criticized for wasting company time i
 n employee reviews.  This claim is entirely unsubstantiated by process or d
 ata\, there is no known method for detecting when projects get off track.  
 You are expected to do only what you are told to do and nothing more\, like
  government jobs.\n\nPersonally\, I treat all work as my field of study\, a
 nd only working on the assigned projects isn't interesting enough to sit in
  front of a computer all day.  Projects aren't seen as a solvable problem b
 ut rather making progress towards some future abstract goal\, that is compl
 etely disassociated from the engineer.\n\nDevOps is entirely useless.  The 
 entire point of DevOps is to bring production quality process to developers
 .  By not doing this\, you are wasting everyone's time.  Teams are segregat
 ed in this regard\, no work is shared.  While people are happy to talk and 
 answer questions\, work is entirely siloed\, and that is the opposite of wh
 at DevOps should be.  Having a separate team just for DevOps is a waste of 
 time and money.  Each team should have a designated DevOps engineer to help
  spread their environments for reliability and consistency.\n\nAdvice to ma
 nagement:\n\nStop employee reviews.  Stop whining about timeline when you y
 ourselves don't track how you spend your time.  Tracking projects in an iss
 ue tracker should be a forethought not and afterthought.  Stop using Waterf
 all methodology.  Get involved in the project throughout\, not just at the 
 beginning or the end.  Stop assigning tasks that the requesting department 
 doesn't ask for and then criticising people for doing things that aren't as
 ked for.\n\nPrioritize tasks instead of stories and you will start to under
 stand the nuance of your precious Waterfall process.  You want to tout the 
 process as being this best thing that saves money if everyone follows it pe
 rfectly\, but you can't admit the whole reason people use Agile instead of 
 Waterfall is to create a feedback loop for the design.\n\nIf your going to 
 stake a claim about process\, or efficiency\, or time management\, validate
  your statements by writing stuff down and presenting in an understandable 
 way to the individual employee\, not as some magic playing card you only pu
 ll out to insult other managers.

DESCRIPTION:I wouldn’t sweat the performance review if I were you by workin
 g more\, but I can understand where some of the misgivings may come from\, 
 just from a misunderstanding of your strengths… If I were someone else\, an
 d I managed the two of us\, I’d rather manage you than I because it sometim
 es can be hard to pin down what drives me to actually do work.  What I mean
  is I don’t usually love the process\, but the result.  I think you enjoy t
 he process most of the time\, which I think is very valuable to tap into an
 d provides a lift when things get to be a real slog\, like helping Jason wi
 th async stuff in insights.  Anyways\, I think you’ve got some real strengt
 hs as a developer and are a great asset to the team - wouldn’t take the per
 formance review too harshly.  You shouldn’t work 90 hours a week\, you shou
 ld probably work 25 hours that are intended to get the work output/result y
 ou’re looking for.  Doing 65 hours of extra work is just going to drain you
 r energy so that getting it done in 25 hours is impossible because those 25
  hours you’ll be drained from doing 90 the week before.  I might work 90 ho
 urs a week sometimes\, but a lot of that’s just thinking about the best way
  to approach the problem that’s in front of me so 25 hours in front of the 
 CPU is more than enough to do the work.  Anyways\, just trying to say don’t
  burn yourself out and look at yourself as an hourly worker.  I would say j
 ust try to be aware of the result you’re trying to achieve and look before 
 you leap.  Time spent thinking about a problem is more valuable than starti
 ng down the wrong path and having to think about it later.  Sometimes the b
 est approach is to take a nap/relax.  Sorry to be long winded\, point is\, 
 I know you’ll be fine.

DESCRIPTION:\n\nExcellent questions coming through the etherweb\; HOW DO WE
  MEDITATE?\n\nThe hard truth is\, meditation is only what you make of it.  
 There is no grand revelation\, there is no sudden on/off switch.  It is a m
 ode of conscious relaxation\, that could lead to sleeping.  Do you lay awak
 e at night thinking?  Unable to fall asleep?  Meditation is at the other en
 d of the string.  Here are the steps I use:\n\n\n\n1) Find a comfortable qu
 iet place.  This can be difficult depending on the city\, maybe put on head
 phones with or without gentle audio to block out sirens.  Kids should alrea
 dy be asleep\, safe and sound.\n\n\n\n2) Imagine.  Some meditations involve
  imagining your favorite "spot"\, middle of a forest or on a tropical beach
 .  Somewhere you think would be relaxing.\n\n\n\n3) Focus.  When you are in
  your relaxing place\, you should focus on relaxing.  Think of every body p
 art\, starting from your toes\, move gently\, just to see if you can relax 
 your toes even more.  Try to get more and more comfortable.\n\n\n\n4) Then 
 think of your legs.  Wiggle them a little until you are sure your muscles a
 ren't being used.  Act like a blob and start thinking about your mid sectio
 n.\n\n\n\n5) Relax your arms at your side\, and try to pull your tense / st
 ressed shoulders down towards your knees.  Stretch your arms above your hea
 d and back down to your side if necessary.\n\n\n\n6) Finally\, focus on rel
 axing your mind and everything above your neck.  Try to focus on controllin
 g your breathing\, it's hard to focus for more than a few minutes but it wi
 ll be worth it.\n\n\n\n7) Every time you breath in\, try to breath in one s
 econd slower.  Start with a 4 second breath in\, and 5 seconds out.  The ne
 xt breath try 5 seconds breath in and 6 seconds breath out.  Breath 6 secon
 ds in and 7 seconds out.\n\n\n\n8) Another technique along with breathing i
 s to focus on a symbol or an object.  Something that means something to you
  like your favorite number or a toy from your childhood.  Try just to focus
  on the one thing\, not searching for any meaning behind it.\n\n\n\n9) Don'
 t compare one meditation to another\, and don't try to find meaning in it. 
  Some people talk about out of body experiences\, and that isn't necessary.
   Just focus on one simple thing inside your mind.  You will know it when y
 ou feel focused\, you mind can always return to that one thing and you will
  feel relaxed.\n\n\n\n10) Attempt meditation in different places.  If you c
 an focus on 1 thing\, then you can use the breathing exercises during a bre
 ak at work\, or in the passenger seat while traveling\, or at night when yo
 u try to fall asleep.

DESCRIPTION:England House has an attic for rent\nSana gave Iga a silver rin
 g from Morocco\, told her "Don't take it off your pinking until you are rea
 dy to get married.  Turn down every rotten proposal\, and only wear it unti
 l you meet someone of value"\nThe ring broke when Iga and I started dating 
 in the first month.  The silver got thinner on the bottom\, wore down after
  3 years of wearing. Sana means a Year in arabic\, favorite number is 12\, 
 boyfriend is Karin\n\nLots of mormons in the 1200 Riorden Ranch\, Flagstaff
  apartments. Realtors office had flashing LED bulbs\, poor electronics\, st
 opped flashing after signing paperwork.  Iga recommended Huy (Wee) Nguyen b
 uy one of these apartments\, Unit 99 when she went to get her nails done.  
 Offered to rent to us after 6 years of being in Phoenix.  Sold very quickly
 .\n\nBoth Huy and Eddie lived in Riorden Ranch and had girlfriends that abu
 sed them\, native American girls.  Wondering why they are single?  Still si
 ngle to this day\, both have cats\, possible depression\, very hard working
 \, Eddie is overweight\, and took adderall and uppers and downers.  Girlfri
 end was a stripper\, stole Igas purse.\n\nSaw a rainbow when moving to Flag
 staff.\n\nA different apartment at 212 S Leroux\, Moses called with an open
 ing within the hour of completing application at Riorden.  Moses Landlady J
 osephine didn't check credit and gave us a key after 20 minutes.  Adopted B
 rian\, me as her "grandson"\, invited us to have chocolate tea and use thei
 r "playroom" and flat-screen cable.  When we are ready to buy a house\, to 
 let her know.\n\nMoses gave me wifi password to save us money.  Password is
  love2Eat.  Met with Josephine and gave me all contacts and responsibility 
 over estate if something should happen to her.  Mentioned she lost a few di
 amonds.  I brought this up with Moses indirectly\, talked about Cullinan Di
 amond. \n\nFavorite restaurant is Josephine'.\n\nThought all music was spea
 king to me personally\nRadio station playing multiple songs overlapping and
  then cut out\nHad exact amount of money we needed\, to pay deposit and mon
 ths rent.\nFreemason Jim Marzoff stops by Leroux and cleans up.\nSana marri
 ed and engineer and moved to San Francisco.\n\nShould introduce Leo to Jose
 phine with Diamond Earrings.\nShould call realtor about London house\, and 
 talk to josie about buying it.\nWent to galvanize\, made a good friend\, an
 d the eyelash\, Lash Affair by Jo Paris happened to be in the same building
 \, got tons of samples\, being friendly to girls relabeling products from C
 hina\, gave Iga $200 of free supplies.  Invited back when owner is there.\n
 Dyshawn Hawkins\n\nEwok could sense Iga was pregnant first\, and put his he
 ad on her stomach\, never did it before\, usually higher up on top of the c
 hair by the head.\n\nStarted making friends with Pino again\, getting bit l
 ess\, climbs on to my head and shoulders.  Our place is too small for him. 
  Made bird noises outside and noticed lots of birds flying towards me.  Spl
 it up bagel for crows outside apartment.\n\nEla's car broke down when we le
 ft the Juke with her\, second car\, only have one parking spot.\nMade frien
 ds with neighbors cat because I recognized the crying meow.  Gave it some c
 hicken\, chased off neighbors dogs\, and now 3 cats show up together in Win
 ona. 12205 Rustler Rd Flagstaff.  Cat karma cleared?\n\nDon had a stroke an
 d Iga went to work for Face and Body\, Leona owner told her "[she'll] never
  get a better job in town"\, put negative energy\, told her she's making a 
 mistake to quit working for $16 per hour\, paid out of Leona's child's fund
 .  Bad karma.  Last November\, warned Swiftpage my wife was moving to Flags
 taff\, never offered remote work\; uncompassionate Phil.\n\nPredicted Ice s
 heet would fall off the arctic shelf.\n\nChris\, Shuli\, Ania\, Vitali\, Iv
 ana want to move to Flagstaff.  Everyone from Airbnb want to move to Flagst
 aff.  Phil\, old boss wants to live in Flagstaff.  Bnb is a good idea becau
 se everyone wants to stay with us.\n\nDave Ramsey is weird\, selling money 
 advice in church.  Jesus was flipping tables.  After realizing this\, the e
 ntire conversation seems really shallow.  Laughed at his ridiculous stories
 .  Stingy Steve thinks money is the most important thing in the world for s
 uccess.  Dave Ramsey could in fact be Satan.\n\nWeird conversation with Cha
 se in Portland.  Approached the van being decorated with paint by Josh and 
 Chase.  Iga started painting.  Asked Chase "Are you doing anything after th
 is?"\, he told me "I am not allowed to tell you.  Alexa and everyone else h
 as been instructed not to tell you also."\nThis threw me through a loop\, c
 ouldn't focus\, felt car sick on the bus.  Worried about not having enough 
 money to make it to the airport in the morning.\nAsked Uncle Dave (pastor) 
 about Revelation.  Alexa hates me questioning Chase and the time he devotes
  to me.  Doesn't like me for it.  Alexa grew up next to Adrian and Michael\
 , had an abused cat.\n\nUninvited from now on to hang out with Michael and 
 Adrian.  Pretend grandchildren of Linda and Steve are sensitive to curse wo
 rds.  Finally trying to stop cursing.  Still rude to have fake grandchildre
 n.  Parents need to learn to focus on their own Damn family.\n\nFake siblin
 gs of Erika\, spend holidays with them instead of our own family.  Framed p
 ictures of Erika all over the house\, finally replaced with wifes and sons.
   Sick or missing something to have other people's kids and Michael and Adr
 ian's kids.\n\nMade Stingy Steve cry over thanking him for supporting me\, 
 but still suffering.  Tried to explain the dissent management system Trump 
 and tech companies are using.  Tried to make them understand the strategy m
 anagers use to "Manage people out" giving them unrealistic deadlines\, bad 
 reviews.  Form Storm Perform Norm.  Thank Steve for helping me not be as bi
 polar as his dad.  Both cried over dealing with bipolar.  Thankfully "I am 
 not like his dad".  Steve was there for us much more than his dad\, sad he 
 isn't as emotional at most of us are.  His dad would run around the neighbo
 rhood waving his hand in the air for 3 days\, and then sleep for 3 days and
  not get out of bed.  Very little interaction with his family.  Glad I am n
 ot like him.\n\nStarted seeing people pain in their eyes.  I can recognize 
 greed from looking at people.  I can recognize the sadness people try to bu
 ry.  The stress from work and family are in their eyes.  Realized this eati
 ng vegetarian breakfast at Breakfast Bar with Johnny the truck driver.  Dec
 ided to take the next 1000 years off.  Bible says there's 1000 years of pea
 ce after Revelation.\n\nJim told me to "Be a man\, and moved your wife away
  from her family to Ohio.  You doin't appreciate the opportunity I am givin
 g to you."  So nervous my palms were sweating for an entire week.  Possible
  case on shingles (shillings) on my hand.  Turned away from my father's mon
 ey to follow my wifes wishes.  McKenzie\, Igas business partner\, his fathe
 r moved his mother out of Utah away from her family\, and she despised the 
 decision for 37 years until his father died.\n\nMcKenzie asked to borrow $1
 4K to buy a property from his dad\, and "his dad told him to make his own w
 ay" and gave 483K to an investor and the guy took off with the money.\n\nFi
 rst time I met Keith\, I told him "Keith\, I realized something\, everyone 
 must be a genius just some of us haven't realized it yet".  Told me about t
 he book Flow.  A year later with Keith\, Ron\, and Iga at Canton Dragon.  R
 on got the fortune cookie "Genius is the ability to make something very com
 plicated very simple."  How do we measure genius?  I made it very simple.  
 10\,000 years of evolution cannot be undone by nurture.  Told me about Flyn
 n effect.\n\nNeighbor on the end unit told me "Don't feed the homeless" bec
 ause the Mayor's daughter uses the bus stop.  Nepotism\, changing public po
 licy because of family.  Told me homeless like to read\, so I give them cop
 ies of Flatland.  Bury food in the ground like MREs from the war\, instead 
 of composting.  Signs of the apocalypse. \n\nAmerican Conservation Experien
 ce (Chris Baker) holds foreign exchange student IDs / Passports hostage.  M
 ai Hua\, Daphney Yoshida victims\, wanted to leave and Chris refused to ret
 urn passports.  Morten had no issue because he was manager\, treated other 
 people poorly.

DESCRIPTION:1) solar system is advertised as saving money\, it costs more n
 ow\n2) the laws and company policies governing solar programs have changed 
 over two years\, but my contract has not. This affects generated "points" t
 hat the local utility APS buys back for pennies on the dollar. This is unet
 hical to sell energy at a higher price than what residents with solar are a
 ble to sell for. There is so little incentive\, the surplus energy might as
  well be wasted instead of "bought back".\n3) 83% coverage claim obfuscates
  the expectation for how much power is actually generated\, output is based
  on the lowest energy use month because they ticked me in to signing up dur
 ing the winter and asked for the previous months bill knowing that they wou
 ld be able to fullfil the minimum expectation.\n4) anti-competitive\, Tesla
  states their solar lease is designed to be "competitive with the local uti
 lity"\, but the local utility has no competition.\n5) harassment and unavai
 lable support. I have written o the Attorney General and received a respons
 e from Tesla (this is good)\, but trying to follow up on it they are unresp
 onsive. They constantly leave me voicemail and tell me to call back to a nu
 mber that I spend hours waiting on hold. They transfer to different departm
 ent each one waiting on hold.\n6) anti-competitive\, Solar Sun Run offers a
  lease that is half the price\, and higher voltage panels that guarantee 10
 0% coverage or they pay the difference. They also offer a buyout option whi
 ch Tesla does not\, I don't think that qualifies as a lease.

DESCRIPTION:1) unpaid vacation\nIn previous roles I survived on 2 weeks vac
 ation. Employees based in Europe are granted 25 days off.\nSwiftpage policy
  is "unlimited PTO" which has 2 unethical implications:\n* the company does
  not have to honor time off requests because there is no hourly accrual\n* 
 if a developer does take time off\, their role can be outsourced\, which is
  common in this industry\n2) unpaid paternity leave\nI informed the team th
 at my wife would like to move to Flagstaff to work on her business before d
 elivering a baby. Swiftpage doesn't offer paternity leave\, this is unethic
 al\n3) harassment and mental abuse\n* My boss told me to work with specific
  people in the company\, after working throughout winter break\, he returne
 d and told me "the work is a waste"\n* My boss ridiculed and humiliated me 
 in front of other teammates as well as behind my back with other employees\
 n* My boss encouraged me to educate myself and the company would cover the 
 cost. I paid for a month of LinkedIn learning after being encouraged by ano
 ther employee to use it. I bought three books specific it the role that I w
 as never compensated for.\n* I was one of 3 people in the company to have a
 n employee review\, and I was the only one who's review was negative. My bo
 sses highlighted my disability 4 times as a negative but HR was never invol
 ved. This is not an equal opportunity company. If my disability was affecti
 ng my job performance\, HR should have addressed the issue with my boss and
  I.\n* By the time HR stopped responding to my emails\, it sunk in that my 
 work for 11 months is a complete waste and not useful to the company. I was
  left with debilitating cognitive dissonance over accepting payment for wor
 thless skills and zero upward momentum or tending to my pregnant wife in a 
 nearby town.\n* "Managing them out" means the employee is given unrealistic
  deadlines as a way to squeeze as much productivity out of them before they
  either quit from stress\, or fail enough to warrant termination.\n* Form\,
  storm\, perform\, norm is an unethical management practice that companies 
 use to stress out teams of employees. Combined with a lack of PTO\, this is
  physically dangerous. I had no contact with HR that my performance\, work 
 ethic\, or attitude were causing a problem for the company.\n4) unhealthy w
 orking conditions. Expected to sit for long periods of time causes poor blo
 od circulation. Ergonomic chairs and standing desks were not available.

DESCRIPTION:1) obfuscated account balance\n2) overpayment\n3) energy suppor
 t program is a lie. APS sent a letter that they could reduce my bill by 25%
  because I am out of work. I have been paying using borrowed funds. This di
 scount was never applied to a single bill since I applied.\n4) bad design t
 hat prevents me from seeing a list of transactions\, and previous billing h
 istory only 2 years makes it impossible to measure the affects of energy ef
 ficient home improvements\n5) support is unavailable\, waiting on hold for 
 many hours\, transferring departments\, disallowing me to select a billing 
 date creates undue hardship that oils easy be resolved by pro-rated bill an
 d setting the billing date to the first of the month\n6) 3 day grace period
  for due date\, should be 15 like a mortgage\n7) harassment by mail\, I am 
 expected to pay my bill within 1 day\, but APS takes months to respond to i
 nquiries.\n8) APS can shut off my power within hours even in the heat\, but
  landlords are not allowed to evict tenants without a court ruling because 
 of the heat. APS policy is unethical because those two concepts conflict wi
 th each other. This has created undue hardship for my pregnant wife an I.

DESCRIPTION:We arrive at a truly devious plan in Exodus. We have lazy Israe
 lites\, overpopulation\, infant genocide\, famine\, and lack of strategic r
 eserves\, and slavery. God intends to fix all of these problems in the stor
 y of Exodus. We also have the problem of commercialization of religion\, po
 lytheism from even further Eastern religions and paganism. We know from mod
 ern history the latter is not solved.\n\nThe pharaoh orders his servants to
  kill the newborns of the Israelites. They refuse and Moses is born and rai
 sed as a native Egyptian. This blurs the lines between culture and ethnicit
 y\, a good problem to have in modern society and ending\, apartheid\, segre
 gation\, and slavery come to mind in recent history. History repeats itself
 \, and apparently our forefathers didn't read that chapter.\n\nMoses asks t
 he pharaoh to free is people just like\, the Civil War in America\, and lat
 er Martin Luther King addressing the political oppression even after slaver
 y was ended in 1902 (source?). How could it take so long to end discriminat
 ion even when the law prohibits it?\n\nThe pharaoh is exemplary in "the har
 dening of the heart". Every time a fellow man\, the Israelites survive his 
 own torment he is angered and wants to oppress them more. Philosophically t
 his is the same as "hard to be happy for others success"\, and greed pursui
 ng people's own gains instead of treating people as equals.\n\nWe now know 
 that locusts have a 7 year cycle in Egypt\, having come after the 7 years o
 f abundance and 7 years of famine it makes sense the locust population woul
 d be abnormal. The river of blood could have been a war from a different pa
 rt of the land that the Israelites were unaware of\, or red algae or bacter
 ia from the hot 7 year famine before the events of Exodus.\n\nFrogs would h
 ave a natural reaction to avoid this\, flies would have a natural reaction 
 to feast on the frogs\, gnats\, and dying algae.\n\nThe event of Passover w
 ould be a coordinated effort to put and end to the practice of infant genoc
 ide\, with the help of ninjas maybe children would be killed at once to cau
 se a traumatic event to prevent future generations from willingly enabling 
 the practice. Since food security was already taught to the Egyptians there
  would no longer be a need to kill newborns for the sake of preventing over
 population. Again the effect is understood before the cause. The effect is 
 ending infant genocide and food security\, and the cause is modernized agri
 culture\, and mass murder.\n\nThis reminds of Thanos' philosophy of "making
  the hard decision" to kill half the universe. But Thanos' shortcoming is t
 hinking he is a God himself\, rather than a pawn in God's ambition.\n\nGod 
 leads the Israelites out of Egypt and wipes out the Egyptians. This could b
 e done by releasing 2 dams outside the knowledge of the Egyptians. The dams
  could have been created from Chinese models of agriculture\, it would take
  years to fill\, causing a possible famine\, but then providing water secur
 ity for future generations. A lower dam was released to part way for Moses 
 and an upper dam was released to cover the Egyptian army.\n\nThis act\, see
 mingly unnatural and too powerful for Moses to perform on his own had the e
 ffect of relieving the Egyptians of their polytheism and paganism. They "se
 e God" acting before them. God being a coordinated effort for the good of f
 uture generations.

DESCRIPTION:In Genesis\, God creates man\, Adam and Eve as a symbol of dipl
 omacy between woman and man.\n\nCain murders Abel\, the most basic human in
 stinct of jealousy is established as a crime against God. The effect is\, t
 here are some problems that require an order higher than natural instinct\,
  higher than a single man's philosophy\, thus modern government is born.\n\
 nGod creates "his" people. Anyone who follows his instructions will be "sav
 ed"\, and those who deviate will be left out of the story\, "history is wri
 tten by the survivors"\, after all.\n\nGod divides his people and scatters 
 them across the world in the tower of Babel. This reminds me of the ancient
  Chinese emperor's ambition to unify the nations of Asia because of the def
 ormity of language\, calligraphy and ultimately all art and thought.\n\nThe
  message is clear\, when communication becomes it's own language and people
  choose to follow their own ambitions instead of God's ambition\, they must
  be broken up. In modern law we refer to this as a monopoly and antitrust. 
 It is the opposite of trusting in God. Since no government\, corporation or
  person is all of God\, none can be entirely trusted to know the enormity o
 f God's ambition.\n\nGod's people are spread across the land\, they have no
  single holy land except all of the land they are fragmented across. Basic 
 rules such as sodomy and prostitution are discouraged because of disease. T
 he effect is disease and the cause for stopping it is fear of God. The caus
 e could have been a volcanic eruption or a fire that took down Sodom and Go
 mora\, and intense dehydration that turned people to salt.\n\nSince there w
 as no knowledge of microbiology 4 thousand years ago\, we understand the ef
 fect of the instructions before understand the cause. The explaination of d
 isease is not available in Genesis. We must reverse the thinking of "cause 
 and effect".\n\nGod creates a holy land for his people in Exodus. In Genesi
 s we're taught that if eye for an eye was a good rule\, the whole world wou
 ld be blind (source?). The first reference to "eye for an eye" comes from t
 he Hammubari texts as a method for determining maximum punishment.

DESCRIPTION:Great book. But now for some reasonable criticism. JBP has a lo
 ud bark for a professional pontificator. Much like Gladwell\, he arrives as
  a tremendous conclusions with very little supporting evidence.\nChapter 1\
 , with ridiculous lobster analogies\, the truth is\, you are welcome to spe
 ak your mind and prop yourself and pretend to be a mighty lobster\, but no 
 one really cares what you think. For proof\, just look at "noreply" address
 es in spammy marketing campaigns\, reviews that are shadow banned because o
 f talking about cost or vulgarity\, and "community guidelines" that give an
 yone an excuse to discredit your grievances.\nChapter 2\, treat yourself li
 ke you are someone responsible for helping. A hard look at human behavior a
 nd how me are destroying our own bodies. This could be more honest if it ta
 lked about drugs\, alcohol is a drug\, prescription medications are drugs. 
 Hardly anyone ever reads the label\, they might find that the active ingred
 ients have been used in Eastern medicine for centuries and a profit seeking
  conglomerate has made a cocktail out of it. The body\, like society\, is t
 oo complicated to understand wholly\, and Western medicine has ruined the p
 ractice of "care"\, turn to Scott Adams to realize that only doctors can fi
 x the problem\, not patients.\nChapter 3\, making friends is hard\, as you 
 get older it becomes harder. Only the good die Young couldn't be more true 
 and this chapter doesn't change that.\nChapter 4\, no one knows who they ar
 e\, self discovery is whimpy like this chapter. Instead compare yourself to
  a very specific trait that you like about people who use their trait to do
  better than you. If you like to start a business take advice from people w
 ho succeeded\, if you like being married take advice from people who stayed
  together not ones that got divorced.\nChapter 5\, don't let your children 
 disappoint you. This is just ridiculous\, we need to turn this on it's head
 . Parent's need to provide a good relationship with their kids no matter ho
 w disappointing they are. Every parent has this problem\, the fault lies wi
 th the parent\, not with the child. Children will always disappoint and eve
 ry parent has issues with it. Get over it parents.\nChapter 6\, set your ow
 n house in order before criticizing others. A statement that couldn't be mo
 re necessary that today. I know Democrats that are happy to vote with a mes
 sy bedroom. This is unacceptable. Clean up your own backyard before trying 
 to clean up others. These instructions will not be followed based on Jordan
 's advice.\nChapter 7\, persue what is meaningful\, too complicated for the
  average citizen. Ecclesiastes said it best\, "everything is meaningless!" 
 But do something that benefits other people.\nChapter 8\, everything is a l
 ie. Business and marketing is a lie. Little White lies. Debt is a lie\, Fed
  reserve is a lie. My government taught me how to lie. Being happy all the 
 time is a lie Fed to the masses from drug companies. If you want to stop ly
 ing\, stop TV commercials first. This chapter offers little consolation.\nC
 hapter 9\, I like this\, the smartest people speak last. The truth is somew
 here in between face value.\nChapter 10\, unfortunately\, this and chapter 
 9 are being destroyed by self righteous anti free speech left-wingers. I gr
 ew up with the poem\, "sticks and stones can break my bones but words with 
 never hurt me." Turns out that is false. Words are dangerous and powerful.\
 nChapter 11\, don't bother skateboarders\, should be heard by our politicia
 ns and city councils. Great idea\, see chapter 1\, no one cares.\nChapter 1
 2\, pet a cat. Good thoughts\, being compassionate to animals is spirituall
 y awakening. People need a break from toil\, but your companies will fire y
 ou over it. Good message but poor execution in today's society.\nThis hasn'
 t cured the chaos in myself.

DESCRIPTION:Here's what I learned about money since being without a job\, s
 ome of these might be obvious\, some of them took lots of research:\n\n\n* 
 When you sell something\, it can be resold\, and resold\, and resold. It's 
 potential value is infinite.\n\n* Similarly\, 1 dollar can be paid\, and re
 paid\, and repaid. $1 is just as valuable as $1 million the only difference
  is how long it takes to circulate through your own pocket. AMERICAN DOLLAR
 S.\n\n* Our parents retire on a budget similar to a fresh college graduate 
 salary. Because of inflation\, this isn't enough to send your grandkids a b
 irthday gift.\n\n* Our government prints money. The Norwegian government gi
 ves it away to millenials and has created tons of millionaires.\n\n* Buying
  power\, that is available debt\, securities\, investments and labor fuel t
 he economy and create a better world. This has nothing to do with the presi
 dent\, politics\, Russia\, or world problems.\n\n* It would be more honorab
 le to pay people well and file chapter 11 than it is to pay people poorly a
 nd limp on. This is the entire point of chapter 11\, it's risk forgiveness 
 for good ideas.\n\n* Credit cards are unsecured debt\, it is very hard for 
 banks to ACTUALLY get the money paid back. It's almost impossible for debt 
 collectors to convert your unsecured debt to secured debt such as a Home Eq
 uity Line Of Credit (HELOC). Which is exactly why I'll never get one.\n\n* 
 Debt collection disappears from your credit history after 7 years\, from ex
 perience medical debt is only 3\, but filing under chapter 7 the credit his
 tory doesn't recover for 10 years. How much sense does that make? Iga is fr
 iendly enough we wouldn't be homeless if we had to settle somewhere else\, 
 I'll take the hit to my credit score.\n\n* Bankruptcy is an American ideal 
 that helps entrepreneurs. Social Security is an American ideal that "raises
  people out of poverty." Neither of these should be taken lightly because t
 hey are some of the best things about America.\n\n* People give up their et
 hics for money. The word Money comes from Mamon\, which is a satanic antago
 nist of greed in ancient religions. In Yiddish\, it translates to Mormon\, 
 and I believe (unverified) they are actually the ones in charge of the "The
  New World Order".\n\n* Israel is named after Azrael\, archangel of destruc
 tion. They thrive on the "Benefits of War"\, a book about it.\n\n* Philosop
 hically\, Ecclesiastes teaches that everything is meaningless! Find joy is 
 doing work that benefits others. This is BIG PICTURE\, and the secret to al
 l prosperity. Money is only a lubricant for trading labor and time for food
  and shelter. \n\n* I'd have more time for "benefiting others"\, if I wasn'
 t so worried about food and shelter.  This is the idea behind Universal Bas
 ic Income that I thought Jim was offering. The philosophical history is des
 cribed by Deuteronomy 24:15 - "Pay them their wages each day before sunset\
 , because they are poor and are counting on it. Otherwise they may cry to t
 he LORD against you\, and you will be guilty of sin."  If everyone took thi
 s rule to heart\, we wouldn't need labor laws and unions and credit debt an
 d overdraft fees.\n\n* The housing market is a bigger bubble than anyone co
 uld possibly imagine. Here's the punch line: https://tifwe.org/resource/fiv
 e-myths-about-jubilee/ Property only goes up according to the county assess
 or %15 every 65 years. The difference between assessor and market value is 
 ridiculous\, $100k+. With baby boomer retiring in 10 years\, and possible p
 assing away in 40\, there will be a huge abundance on inadequate housing th
 at's been lived in. Just like the abundance of diamond rings. I have no dou
 bt that in 40 years most markets we think of as being high ROI will complet
 ely crash and be rebuilt in to something new.\n\n\n\n\nNow that we all unde
 rstand the secret to life\, can Steve and Linda honestly say they enjoy tak
 ing orders for minimum wage from idiots? If the answer is no\, stop signing
  separation agreements.

DESCRIPTION:2 Chronicles 15:7\n\nIf my plan is to prove God exists\, does t
 hat conflict with Deuteronomy 6:16 or Mathew 4:7\n\n2 theories that will ta
 ke a lifetime to prove.\n\n1) I record every event that leads to success\, 
 and eventually I can make mathematical sense of the probability it would ha
 ppen. This would allow me to predict events for others. E.g. I call a recru
 iter that spends one day in the office per year who takes me call that lead
 s to a good job. 1/365 chance I call on the right day?\n\n2) Maslow's hiera
 rchy. If I identify a missing component and then give it to someone as a gi
 ft but I attribute it to God. God will undeniably be a part of their own se
 lf actualization\, and they will change beliefs. Atheists actualize themsel
 ves and pretend not to care that 40% of the people who helped them along th
 e way also believe in God.

DESCRIPTION:I thought Wendy's nephew was trying to steel a Nerf dart and I 
 but him the face.\n\nI asked a girl if I could kiss her in highschool\, she
  told me she has MS. I don't know if that was meant to discourage me.\n\nWh
 en I first went to PCS I thought I was being controlled by Iga when she cal
 led in\, but it was an honest mistake and we called her back. I can't tell 
 the difference if someone is trying to manipulate me through some force of 
 the universe or if it was just a mistake.\n\nAt Andrew's wedding I asked Ch
 ase while they were decorating the get-away car if they are doing anything 
 after since the wedding stopped at 9. I imagined Chase said "everyone has b
 een instructed not to tell you." Chase completely denies it.\n\nWorking wit
 h Don on the salon. I couldn't tell if he was teasing me by asking me to pi
 ck something up\, set it down\, pick it up again\, change tools every 2 sec
 onds. Rus taught me it's most efficient to stick with the same tool as long
  as you can in order to get the whole process done. Thought I left a realit
 y and everything was mixed up and backwards because of me. No self esteem. 
 I imagined two alcohol sales reps\, I asked "what are you up to?" One respo
 nded "selling booze". I went back to my work and thought I overheard him sa
 y "see what I mean?" Couldn't tell if they were talking about me or talking
  about alcohol sales.\n\nAt Charles Schwab. Taylor said "you did so good on
  that document"\, knowing full well no one ever wants to see it again and n
 o one actually reads it. Rational Unified Process is useless and they used 
 it to make my feel unpleasant\, because Charles Schwab can afford to abuse 
 it's employees. Like the lady that comes to work with pink eye who is 80 ye
 ars old. I thought the entire building with set up just to taunt me. Or the
  lady with pink eye was really suffering.\n\nA Tesla employee called me to 
 make fun of me for signing the solar lease contract that costs me more mone
 y than it generates in "buy back" credits\, invented in 2016 after they tri
 cked me in to signing it in 2015 by saying verbally "this will save you mon
 ey every year". 16\,050 kWh times $.07 is just over $1000 but the system co
 sts over $2000 annually.\n\nAt Swiftpage\, Drew comes over and tells me "Ph
 il needs to choose his battles." I can't tell if they are gossiping to incr
 iminate me or just arguing amongst themselves.\n\nCall with SIMCOM\, when I
  called the gentleman asked me "you applied through Indeed right?" I said "
 I think so\, I can't remember." I was just being agreeable and failed his l
 ie detector test. I imagined he lied by omission\, knowing full well that a
 pplications are accepted through ADP. In the process\, proving I am unworth
 y.\n\nJim said\, "I will pay for your ticket to Poland and 6 months rent." 
 I have text history. When we got back from Poland\, he didn't pay\, I imagi
 ned he is lying.\n\nDigit.co felt like they were trolling me. Couldn't conn
 ect to WiFi\, there were dozens with overlapping signals. Airbnb quiz had a
  missing video from bad WiFi or an error. Website clearly says they only hi
 re locals but offered to fly me in from Phoenix. No feedback\, they might h
 ave known I'm psychotic but didn't want to insult me\, this made Michael sa
 d.\n\nCan't tell if being bullied and alienated my entire life is because t
 here is something about me people don't like\, or if I've already been elec
 ted for a higher purpose. Like the blistering of my right hand has somethin
 g to do with God's right hand being murdered on a cross.\n\nIf I stop sinni
 ng for a specific number of days\, will good things start happening to me? 
 Proof of God's existence and the philosophical correctness of 4\,000 year o
 ld texts?

DESCRIPTION:\n\nDoesn't Recommend\nNegative Outlook\nDisapproves of CEO\nI 
 worked at Zovio full-time (More than 3 years)\n\nPros\n\nDecent pay\, but n
 ot worth anything about the job. This job will make you strong and fearless
  until you eventually (or quickly) pursue another job elsewhere.\n\nCons\n\
 nI worked for Bridgepoint for several years\, starting in the admissions ad
 visor role and transitioning into higher management\, and over the duration
  of my tenure\, the most pervasive feeling I experienced in the workplace i
 s fear. There is constant fear among employees across the organization\, an
 d the problem has only increased with Bridgepoint's attempt to transition i
 nto an OPM.\nThe sense of fear is encouraged by the negative upper manageme
 nt style\, the lack of communication\, constant changes in business practic
 es\, large layoffs over several years\, inconsistent training and correctiv
 e action\, and unrealistic production goals. Racism is frequently swept und
 er the rug by HR\, and bullying is allowed to occur across the floor withou
 t reproach. There is little recognition of success\, and resources are freq
 uently taken away from the general advisor population even as goals are inc
 reased. The workplace is highly competitive because Bridgepoint has turned 
 education into a cutthroat industry\, and any talk of it being a "team envi
 ronment" are an absolute joke.\nBenefits have been stripped away as a cost 
 saving measure\, and the L&D team has been whittled down to one or two peop
 le handling all of the training for hundreds of employees. Managers are giv
 en no explicit training before taking on their new role\, and teams are bro
 ken up and moved around on an almost weekly basis. All of the best employee
 s are leaving\, and the good ones who remain are only sticking around to fi
 nish their education on Bridgepoint's dime before they all leave as well. A
  few older members of staff only remain because they're afraid to try to lo
 ok elsewhere.\nIf there is one thing that is consistent in the Bridgepoint 
 workplace\, it's how inconsistent\, confusing\, and frightening everything 
 about it is.\nIf I were a potential future client looking to enlist OPM ser
 vices from an outside organization\, I would take a close look at the extre
 mely negative Bridgepoint outcomes for the students they've previously "ser
 ved" (less than 20% graduation rates for some programs)\, the way they trea
 t their employees\, and the lawsuits they are currently tied up in over the
  way they have been treating their "students". Overall\, a disastrous compa
 ny with a handful of amazing people who happen to work there\, but nothing 
 more.\nShow Less\n\nAdvice to Management\n\nInvest in your people\, invest 
 in your technology and resources\, invest in your L&D team. These investmen
 ts may save this sinking ship.\n\nZovio Response Dec 28\, 2018 – VP\, Talen
 t\, HR Ops\, &amp\; Total Rewards\nThank you for your years of service to o
 ur students. With over 139\,000 alumni\, we have a lot to be proud of\, but
  there is always room for improvement. Our increasing GPTW scores\, NPS / S
 tudent Experience\, and direction into a new space as an Ed Tech Services e
 ntity are all very exciting and positive. If you have specific\, constructi
 ve recommendations\, then please connect with me. philip.dana@bpiedu.com\n\
 nI have been working at Zovio full-time (More than 3 years)\n\nPros\n\nDown
 town Denver\nEco Pass\n\nCons\n\nunethical\nno work life balance\nbad cultu
 re\n\nAdvice to Management\n\nAs some one who has worked with this company 
 for 3 years I have seen enough. One thing I will say to all of thou thinkin
 g of starting a job here is that it will not be worth moving to Colorado fo
 rm another state. Just trying to save you all money and time. There are opp
 ortunities if you need a degree for Ashford that will be useful to you but 
 coming to work here for a free random degree is not worth the time as the c
 ompany is a mess.\nEmployee retention in low because people are not treated
  right. Managers are unethical and everyone turs a blind eye. I’m sure they
  break whistle blowing laws and the compliance department is a joke. People
  who enroll high are tell students lies and are never corrected. The compan
 y has taken a major fall since the law suit last year in California. The st
 ock has been down 55-50 % since January of this year and they are scrabblin
 g. The pay can be decent but taking a job here could eb a waste of time as 
 they fire people or drive them to quit daily.\nWork like balance is horribl
 e. We used to have a 9-6 schedule and now they are varying the schedules so
  that people have shifts from 7am though 7pm seven days a week.\nManagers a
 re asked to put good reviews on Glass Door\, so I would not believe the out
 landish great reviews. They either come from Arizona where people just star
 ted and have not seen how the sausage is made\, or they are from some manag
 er who has drank the Kool-Aid. Denver and San Diego have seen the mess that
  is Bridgepoint. With all of there unlawful labor law\, and Department of E
 ducation\, and VA shenanigans they have been forced in to a market that wil
 l give them a new start but we will see how long that lasts.\nThink twice b
 efore you take a job here and if you so keep looking for a new job as a Pla
 n B!

DESCRIPTION:A proverb is a general piece of advice that survives the test o
 f time. A colloquialism is like a proverb but it is significant to a specif
 ic culture or group of people. A social network is a digital map of interac
 tions and relationships between people. The social network is a digital for
 m of something that our brains have been capable of organizing for millions
  of years.\n\nBirds for example\, every morning navigate towards other bird
 s that sound and act like them. They record familiar chirps in their memory
 \, and they ask each other for food.\n\nProverbs are significant because th
 ey help generations survive\, kind of like the bird chirping\, they help us
  find food and stay out of danger. Imagine being able to communicate our go
 als and expectations using only proverbs. Thinking about the people we know
  and who the timeless information might be relative to is the neurological 
 form of social networking. No computers needed\, until now.\n\nSuccess is m
 easurable. Society measures success by a person’s wealth. Wealth is defined
  as a person’s “net value”\, the sum total of how much money and assets a p
 erson has. But\, wealth is more than a number. Wealth is familiar\, how man
 y people are willing to say nice things about you. Emotional wealth\, how h
 appy a person is. If a person never needs therapy\, or goes to therapy and 
 feels better. Our ability to “die happy”\, means a person has led a success
 ful life.\n\nWith the use of computers and social networking\, we can put a
 n exact value on a person’s success. In chaos we attract chaos\, in order w
 e attract order.

DESCRIPTION:Onions for breakfast and why outcome matters more than intentio
 n\nThere are some times in life when good intentions should have been avoid
 ed all-together. The outcome is what matters. "It's the thought that counts
 ." Is a cop-out for people who give/receive shitty gifts.\nI'll give you so
 me examples of common "good ideas" and why this is making life harder for t
 he rest of us.\nRecruiting is about relationships\nDoes anyone disagree?\nR
 ecruiting is about relationships with people. Potential employees for compa
 nies. People who are good and bad at working together\, recruiters have a w
 ay of sifting through all the people to find the right one.\nHere's where t
 his idea goes awry. Companies are looking for the right "one"\, implies tha
 t a company will only hire one employee. I've entered many companies only t
 o find out they need more help than what I can provide. How can I be expect
 ed to fix all their technical problems?\nThe other problem with modern recr
 uiting is that it's "about people". We all want to work with people who are
  friendly. We all try to avoid people who are overly opinionated and unplea
 sant. Why then\, is recruiting about relationships\, when all I care about 
 is finding a job?

DESCRIPTION:Failing to start-up and other non-sense experience\nI've failed
 . Big time. And now I'm burnt.\nFor 3 years I tried to start an educational
  software company. The plan was\, I would be CTO or second to the CTO if we
  hired one. I'd help run the company for 10 years\, and come out the other 
 end a nobleman. Providing software services schools and students need.\nWhe
 n I first got out of college\, I thought I could burn myself out while I'm 
 young and avoid an age 50 mid-life crisis. I thought start-ups would be the
  fastest way to gain a lot of experience. I would have piles of work\, and 
 zero job security.\nI later realized\, all that great experience is pretty 
 much useless because no one wants to hire a failure. I have no portfolio of
  past work. I have nothing\, no background\, or any success\, which I can s
 tand on and say\, "I made this\, and it was great."\nThe company is yours n
 ow\n$300\,000 in the hole\, and my business partner tells me\, "the company
  is yours now." Out of all the experience I gained from working with startu
 ps\, I haven't learned anything about marketing. I understand that if I was
  a kind person\, people would like working with me. I assume this applies t
 o companies. Companies that are kind and do a lot of good for their custome
 rs\, retain and grow with more customers.\nI ruined the company because I n
 ever learned how to work well with other people. No one wants to hire an em
 ployee with this mindset. The first startup I worked for\, the Founder syst
 ematically eliminated all men from the office\, while promoting and hiring 
 family members who were female. None of the startups I've worked for paid h
 ealth insurance so I could go to therapy to work out these problems.\nMy re
 sume has a gap\nRecruiters interrogate this fact of my resume. I don't know
  why people ask about it when they already know\, no matter the answer\, it
  will discourage them from working with me.\nNo one is going to hire an emp
 loyee they think is going to abandon ship at the first sign of trouble. No 
 one wants to hire an "unproductive."

  - like Lagos\, but a paradise for monsters (Quake 2 port).\nC137 - Earth -
  copy images from google search and reconstruct like Photosynth\, some GTA 
 dynamics\nMirror dimension - like other dimensions but scrambled by new wor
 ld builder and new physics particle engine\nZion - matrix mod dynamics \nMa
 rio world mod - needs a good name\nDuke nukem worlds\nMars/underworld - Doo
 m series imports\nStory mode realms like The Game from Ender's game.\nAny g
 ame we are nostalgic about\, use the world builder to port over from existi
 ng graphics. Probably won't even have to be played in order to steal the gr
 aphics.\nOlympia - games and completions and sports modes for God's of gami
 ng.\n\n\nShort term:\nAdd auto-aim as a part of gameplay - everyone should 
 be able to beat a bot\nAdd ray tracing\nAdd http socket listener to C serve
 r\nAdd Cell shading as a toggle flag\nCombine new features with Open Arena\
 nAdd mapping tools to an in game world builder\nAdd physics based events\nM
 ake bots smarter by training them to complete the skill tester mod\nMake li
 nux image smaller for emscripten browser load\nAdd Event sourcing to server
  state\, use it to create multiple timelines and simulate AI\nGenerate worl
 ds from patterns used in existing maps. - like painting a Bob Ross painting
  but using vectors

DESCRIPTION:http://36questionsinlove.com/\n\n1) Hunter Thompson\, so I coul
 d ask him what happened to him that makes him so angry.\n2) If I were famou
 s it would be as a mental health martyr.\n3) I reheard conversations in my 
 head constantly. I think it makes me more compassionate especially when pro
 voked.\n4) A perfect day is when I feel like I've done something and a can 
 rest next to my wife.\n5) I sing in my head constantly. "I pray every singl
 e day\; for revolution".\n6) Mind over matter.\n7) Assisted suicide at an o
 ld age\, possibly in Norway.\n8) We take work very personally\, it is our l
 ife's work\, it is unprofessional at time.\n9) Multiple people have saved m
 y life\, I am grateful for them.\n10) The beatings I took. I'm apparently t
 he first generation to know the difference between discipline and punishmen
 t.\n11) I grew up in Ohio\, my dad works in manufacturing and would take me
  to the shop to see how things are built. My step dad always worked in the 
 software industry. As a kid I always like to take things apart and put thin
 gs together. I was bullied a lot but I thought I grew out of it in highscho
 ol when I made a point to stop pestering people and keep my mouth shut. In 
 college I drank too much and did too many drugs. I studied computer science
 \, and built systems upon systems\, I streamed music to my phone before iPh
 one and 3G even existed. I've worked in education for a decade\, and then w
 orked in the medical field briefly. I finally realized my career was going 
 no where and quit my job. Now I feel mentally ill about all my actions. I f
 eel sick from letting bad managers let me fail as some sort of passive aggr
 essive attempt to break my confidence.\n12) How to fly a helicopter.\n13) H
 ow long does it take to climb the hill of hope\, looking for as destination
 .\n14) I've always wanted to go to My Huashan to visit the monastary on the
  side of a cliff. Haven't gone because traveling is expensive.\n15) One tim
 e I wrote and app\, and then when a small kid was testing it\, I saw their 
 face light up when they realized I could make a spelling correction they fo
 und and saw it change before their eyes.\n16) Honesty and humility.\n17) Th
 e day I met my wife.\n18) Seeing eyes dilated as life leaves the physical f
 orm.\n19) I wouldn't change a thing if I suddenly died.\n20) Friendship is 
 accepting and caring for a person even if you don't always agree with them 
 100%.\n21) I'm surrounded by love and affection\, it plays a big role in my
  life.\n22) \n23) My family is luke warm. My childhood was probably better 
 than most\, but not as good as children deserve.\n24) My mother is a wonder
 ful person and a constant inspiration to me in regards to kindness.\n25) \n
 26) I wish I had someone who I could share a gourmet meal with.\n27) I care
  more about being friends than money.\n28) \n29) \n30) This morning.\n31)\n
 32) Prison rape.\n33) I would regret not tell my family I love them\, every
  day.\n34) A box with sentimental items from WWII.\n35) My son's death woul
 d be traumatic. No parent should ever have to outlive their child.\n36) How
  do I advance my career when no one thinks I am qualified to serve others?

DESCRIPTION:\n\nStill rearranging some changes unnecessary changes and I ma
 y have lost video resizing. The current list of priorities after PR:\n* Web
 RTC for inter-build communication over UDP\n* Arcade mode\, it starts playi
 ng from compressed demo state data in the background like it's advertising 
 in an arcade.\n* ^ Related\, offloading GPU usage to Google Cloud or (AWS E
 lastic Graphics + Elastic Transcoder) for online streaming. Only loads Open
 GL in the browser when playing offline\, otherwise uses a simple video stre
 am (e.g. x11vnc + Xvfb worked ok\, I have a Dockerfile for the client + htt
 p server\, but transcoding directly to MP4 and streaming your own game play
  from Youtube would be an incredible pipeline IMO).\n---- Render worlds usi
 ng a video stream\, render standard dumbed down graphics\, menu system\, we
 apons\, items\, etc locally\, things that don't change between maps get ren
 dered locally because they can be downloaded once\, everything else like wo
 rld graphics are offloaded to content/video servers.\n* Full support for We
 bGL2? Requires rewrite of shaders.\n* Support for other open source builds 
 OpenArena\, UrbanTerror\, Jedi Academy\, Star Trek Voyager\, Excessive+ if 
 they are in to that\, I don't see code so I can't PR a javascript front-end
 . :(\n* Merge ray-tracer\, cel-shader\, auto-aim\, smarter AI\, train AI to
  complete skill-test-mods\, better physics options\, Matrix bullet time\, r
 ailgun frenzy\, freeze tag (i.e. cops and robbers\, vampires and zombies)\,
  (etc\, I have a whole list)\, \n* Make sure visual and game play options c
 an be configured during game play\n* Merge with previous game content\, Qua
 ke Portal in particular because Excessive+ p0rtal doesn't have source code 
 posted.\n* In game builder like Minecraft\, merge with gtk? I thought Quake
  4 came with the developer engine?\n* Make linux image smaller for emscript
 en browser load\, no need to include game data or install q3 because it com
 es from the server.\n* Add Event sourcing (e.g. AWS SMQ) to server state\, 
 use it to create multiple timelines and simulate AI.\n* I read adding parti
 cle physics and generative models would be impossible\, but I don't think s
 o\, bots and player skins can be added during game play\, why can't new mod
 els that are created from an outside source?\n* Webkit renderer that conver
 ts the menu system to HTML and can read HTML/CSS as a design format for cre
 ating the menu system in game natively.\n\nGameplay mods:\nDone - physics m
 od\, jump higher (player strength\, non-gravity)\, run faster (included\, g
 _speed)\, run up walls\nRecreate score skycam for single player like Doom\,
  show the number of secrets found\, enemies killed\, accuracy percentage fr
 om corkscrew mod\, area covered\, etc\nLevel Golf mod - 18 levels lined up 
 with seamless teleporter in between\, must get the number of kills as the n
 umber number\, first level is 1 kill. Portal opens\, if an under-ranked pla
 yer without enough kills tries to cross levels they are gibbed. If not enou
 gh players in the level\, bots are added\, until bots get enough kills or a
 re killed off by human players and do not respawn.\nConvert exit deathmatch
  and falling off maps to teleporters instead of gibs.\nProcedurally generat
 e levels based on procedurally generated bot paths.\nWorld inside a world\,
  map with global showing cameras to the outside world\, falling off the edg
 e you go through a teleporter and maintain speed. one side you look huge li
 ke a monster\, the other wide dark and scary to make you feel small. Do sky
 boxes and cameras go well together?\nCombine Rally with players to get a GT
 A like feel\nFootball\, baseball\, sports mods\, etc\nCombine platformer wi
 th geoball to make pinball game\nCombine platformer and dungeon generator t
 o make diablo\, guildwars\, enter the gungeon\, gauntlet style game\nStarfo
 x game with airplane models\nRealistic games like UrT\, Pubg\, CoD\, etc.\n
 \n\n\n\nPlease let me know if anyone wants to add or change the list of mod
 s\, I have hardly looked at any of these mods code\, but I was going to org
 anize all game dynamics in my /data directory and try to make very little c
 hange to the actual engine. I.E all physics mods become a new physics modul
 e that any game.qvc can defer to for help on the front end.

DESCRIPTION:Signs you might be suffering from Psychosis\nBrian Cullinan\nBr
 ian Cullinan\nMar 24 · 4 min read\n\nI keep a news feed with occasional art
 icles on psychology. I never studied psychology in school\, but it’s a topi
 c I’m interested in and I’ve read about extensively since then.\nEvery now 
 and then\, I come across an article with a vague and unsatisfying descripti
 on of the human condition. Psychosis is described as “losing touch with rea
 lity.” This isn’t enough for me\, partly because I’m entrepreneurial and re
 jecting the current reality is a part of my creative process. This descript
 ion lacks concrete examples of how people can lose touch with reality.\nI t
 hink people are lying to me\nPeople are awful to each other sometimes. I’ve
  heard you even hurt the ones you love the most. You hurt people you love b
 ecause you want them to prove themselves to you\, that they are worthy of y
 our love.\nWhen I am suffering from psychosis\, I can’t tell if someone is 
 lying to me intentionally\, or if they accidentally make some blunder of sp
 eech that causes a miscommunication. I think that people are lying to me in
  order to hurt me.\nI think I am being bullied\nWhen I have a psychotic epi
 sode\, I think people are making fun of me. I think they are laughing at me
  when I ask them for help. This happened to me in the work environment. To 
 make it worse\, the bullies control my livelihood and only source of income
 . They might say something like\, “This work is so important.” even though 
 we both know it isn’t as important as life\, family\, happiness\, and healt
 h. Or\, “Why don’t you do this? Why can’t you follow instructions?” even th
 ough we both know the instructions are bad and incomplete.\nI found this ar
 ticle about Inuit child rearing to be helpful. The punchline is\, people wh
 o are bullies think I take life too seriously. Taking life too seriously me
 ans I have a negative attitude. When something goes wrong\, I take it as a 
 deep personal failure of my character. The truth is\, things go wrong all t
 he time\, completely out of my control. I am still alive\, even after all t
 he little things go wrong.\nI imagine grandiose manipulation\nI imagine I a
 m being alienated by people around me. I imagine people laughing at me beca
 use they think I’m funny when I am not trying to be funny. I imagine people
  saying things to me\, that didn’t actually happen.\nI’ve even imagined tha
 t I am stuck in some Alternate Reality Game\, like in the movie “The Game” 
 with Michael Douglas. I think everyone is in on the big secret that they sh
 ould pick on me\, just to get me to behave differently. I also imagine ever
 yone around me talks about how they are going to manipulate me behind close
 d doors.\nI get emotional with no apparent cause\nWhen I was working at a m
 edical company\, I asked for time off because I didn’t take any vacation da
 ys for an entire year. My boss at the time tried to talk me out of\, border
 line threatening to fire me because I take time off. It was written in my c
 ontract that vacation time is accrued\, but this didn’t matter to my boss.\
 nSome days\, I wake up\, like lots of people do\, and feel completely awful
 . Maybe the cause is diet\, or stress\, or fake lighting. This causes me to
  go in to a depressive state that can last for days. Work obligations make 
 the depression worse because now I feel like I am falling short of my goals
  and other people’s expectations.\nI imagine myself in life threatening sit
 uations\nI imagine every time I get in to a car that I will get in an accid
 ent and die. When someone does something wrong\, like charges me a late fee
 \, I imagine myself doused in gasoline and lighting myself on fire in their
  office. Late fees are the worst\, I am being punished because of external 
 factors outside of my control.\nWhen I try to stand up for myself\, I imagi
 ne myself in a courtroom. I imagine retaliating against other people with a
 ctions that would definitely send me to jail\, such as screaming profanitie
 s in public\, threatening people\, or even becoming violent. I feel suicida
 l.\nI am scared and untrusting of society\nI don’t know who to trust. Part 
 of this\, I think\, is because I’ve seen the depths of the internet. I’ve s
 een how people can use the internet to extort money\, lie\, harass\, and ab
 use people. As someone who’s studied computer security\, we are required to
  assume everything is untrustworthy\, and then work to make it trustworthy 
 again.\nWhen someone lies to me\, and I learn the truth\, this makes them u
 ntrustworthy. If I am imagining someone lying to me intentionally to hurt m
 e\, they become untrustworthy even though I imagined it. I don’t trust peop
 le that ask me for money. I definitely don’t trust companies.\nThis conditi
 on makes me feel completely alone\, even though there might be lots of peop
 le who feel the same way. I let go of all logic and reason\, I can’t tell w
 ho to trust.

DESCRIPTION:While this may seem like a fun mental exercise\, it isn’t fun t
 o live caught between these two realities. I’ve been assaulted\, my well-be
 ing put on the line. Online-bullying appears to be rampant\, but there is n
 o way to stop it or prove it. I’ve seen a person with a police badge in the
 ir profile\, if they aren’t really an officer\, isn’t this illegal (imperso
 nating an officer)? How do you know if the person you are talking to is an 
 alternate profile they set up to avoid their parents noseyness\, or someone
  trying to steal your identity? When someone asks for the last 4 digits of 
 your social security for a job interview\, how do I know they aren’t enteri
 ng it into my bank to gain access to my account?\nIn Backwards World\, I re
 ceive mail that looks like checks. I get phone calls telling me I am being 
 Federally investigated. Passive-aggressive employers ask me what I am an “e
 xpert” in\, knowing full well\, I don’t have the confidence to claim any ex
 pertise in anything\, really.\nThe American Ideal is DEAD! Values taught to
  me by my European wife\, such as “money back guarantee\,” are no longer Am
 erican Ideals. When someone rich commits a crime\, they go free. When someo
 ne poor commits a crime\, they go to prison. False advertising is everywher
 e\, but no one can ever prove or stop it from happening. In Backwards World
 \, Tesla Solar charges more money than they save you\, APS\, Comcast\, TelC
 el are all government supported monopolies who don’t care about their custo
 mers.\nThe best part of Backwards World is Donatos Pizza is finally spread 
 across the US\, featured at Red Robin. Being from Ohio\, I never thought it
  would happen. I have missed the crispy edge-to-edge pepperoni and toppings
  with a crispy thin crust and corn flour bottom. If this happened in Forwar
 ds World also\, perhaps the two realities have started to reconverge! Let’s
  turn this ship around\, matey!

DESCRIPTION:I like to think that in happiness and misery\, I am not alone. 
 There must be someone out there in the world that agrees with my “opinions”
 .\n\nUsually when I have an “opinion”\, the people at the receiving end don
 ’t know\, or care about the amount of time and research I’ve put in to deve
 loping an “opinion”. So much effort\, that I seem to construe my ideas as s
 cientific fact.\nI’ll share some research on no-reply email addresses with 
 the world\, and maybe someday it will be appreciated.\nWhat is a “no-reply”
  email?\nIn marketing\, a no-reply email is a part of an Advertising Campai
 gn. Someone in an office designed an email to sell you a product\, or an au
 tomatic response to an inquiry a customer has made about a business.\nEvery
  time you click “Contact Us”\, or apply for a job\, or even order a product
 . The customer is shortly greeted with a response\, similar to “We have rec
 eived your request and will get back to you shortly” or “Your order is bein
 g processed and will be shipped soon.”\nThis may seem pleasant at first\, b
 ut if you look at who sent the email\, it usually says “no-reply@arogant.bi
 z” Why is this?\nA no-reply email is sent by a remote machine\, and the sen
 der\, or original configurator doesn’t want a response. However\, sometimes
  I do respond. Here is less than fascinating part of my research. Some no-r
 eply email addresses actually send a reply. The reply usually consists of “
 This is an invalid email address\, and no one will see your message.” I get
  this from Amazon! The largest online retailer in the world sends a respons
 e from their no-reply emails. I especially hate this response when it comes
  to dealing with support.\nWhy is no-reply bad for business?\nI have starte
 d multiple businesses. Over the years\, I’ve never considered using a no-re
 ply email address. Instead\, I send all emails and marketing communications
  from\, for example\, admin@honorable.biz. This is a virtual email address 
 set up to copy to brian@honorable.biz and ceo@honorable.biz\, or whoever el
 se the email might be relevant to.\nI manually check every business inquiry
 . Kind of like jeff@amazon.com\, but lately I haven’t been getting replies.
  Since his divorce\, I think he doesn’t want to hear it anymore and blocks 
 all non-work-related emails.\nThere are\, however\, legitimate reasons why 
 a person would want to reply to an expectedly one-way-communication. For ex
 ample\, if a person doesn’t know how to unsubscribe\, they might respond “p
 lease unsubscribe me”. Instead of hitting the “Report Spam” button and tarn
 ishing your reputation because of errors in unwanted communication.\nWhat i
 s a solution?\nYears ago while setting up Postfix on Linux\, I realized I c
 an filter all incoming messages on my mail server to run through a series o
 f scripts. I could reorganize emails server-side\, instead of client-side l
 ike Outlook rules. I had dozens of email addresses set up for every service
  and website I ever signed up for. I put all my emails in their own folders
  so that I WAS IN CONTROL. Instead of being blasted constantly by marketing
  emails\, I could seek out the information I want\, WHEN I WANT TO.\nNo mor
 e did I get an email notification at 2 AM in the morning because someone fr
 om another timezone decided to blast thousands of customers. Why is this ev
 en a thing?\nChange your email address in marketing emails from no-reply@ar
 ogant.biz to support@honorable.biz.\nMy opinion sprinkled with truth salt\n
 Businesses who claim to care about their customers actually don’t\; they on
 ly care about money.\nIf companies could\, they would send someone to your 
 home to shout in your face at 2 AM in the middle of the night.\nCompanies d
 on’t have time or care about feedback or criticisms.\nThe Marketing departm
 ent and the Support department are incapable of communicating with each oth
 er.\nThis pretty much sums up American businesses. Some people detest using
  traffic stops to fight crime. I detest Tech companies acting like wizards 
 behind the curtain\; using it as a veil of perfection.\nI hope this changes
 \, because until it does\, I enjoy forcing your support team to share my mi
 sery. Maybe I am just nit-picking.

DESCRIPTION:\nWe’ve all received it at times. Recently\, I read an article 
 on the WSJ about calling the next generation “entitled” as a sort of genera
 tional hazing that has to happen to get us to… work harder? I’m not really 
 sure what it accomplishes.\nThere seems to be two sort of modes for “Manage
 ment Theory”. I put it in quotes because this is the bullshit Harvard is te
 aching business students these days. I started recognizing it thanks to our
  gracious President\, Donald Trump. Who\, if you have a problem with\, is r
 eally just a reflection of your own problems and hatred towards yourself. I
  don’t care about how much you hate yourself\, not in the context of this a
 rticle at least.\nManagement 1: Form\, Storm\, Perform\, Norm\nThese are th
 e slave-drivers. Middle managers who think they are being productive my “pu
 tting the pressure on”. Hiring new employees\, giving them more work than t
 hey can handle\, measuring productivity\, and laying off the ones that don’
 t meet their imaginary “status quo”\; the “no-loads”. Read more about it he
 re.\nI believe\, this is what our President is doing. He is promoting peopl
 e to positions they want\, taking a small risk\, and when they feel like th
 ey have aged 10 years in just 6 months\, he sweeps his cabinet again. Cheer
 io.\nWe are observing in our most high office the enactment of bad manageme
 nt advice. Isn’t it great? There is another principle that applies\, especi
 ally to those like Alex Ocasio Cortes\, is it called The Peter Principle (l
 inked here). This basically states that a person will climb to the highest 
 possible position on the corporate ladder until they are completely unquali
 fied.\nWhy wouldn’t the House of Reps prop up someone young and energetic? 
 It is the way of the world right? The next generation has to step up and sp
 eak for themselves. She hasn’t lived long enough to be afraid of opening he
 r loud mouth on every facet of society she doesn’t like. I’m willing to bet
  that AOC can’t even tell the difference between opinions and facts.\nCure:
  Angels\nI’m not talking about the floating figures shrouded in glowing lig
 ht\; or babies with wings. I mean angel investors. People who are willing t
 o spend their hard earned savings in order to see the world change. People 
 who want to learn something about this world so badly they are willing to k
 iss it all goodbye.\nPeople\, who have something figured out and want to sh
 are it. There aren’t enough angels in this world. Here’s the secret about p
 roductivity\, and I hope this reaches someone who has been laid off\, or ha
 tes their “corporate world” job. White-collar jobs aren’t productive. I rea
 d recently that tech workers are trying to form unions. The whole point of 
 a union was to save people from dying of black-lung. You work in air-condit
 ioning all day. As my father put it\, “qwitchurbitchen”.\nYou don’t actuall
 y make anything in a white-collar role. If you were making something\, like
  a wooden train\, you could measure how many wooden trains you are making a
 nd get paid accordingly. In a white-collar job\, the produce of your effort
 s are entirely ephemeral. You can’t say for sure if you place 10 phone call
 s all of those people are going to sign up\, or maybe they sign up one year
  and the next year they quit you because you care more about signing people
  up than actually building a quality product.\nHanlon’s razor\nDon’t attrib
 ute to malice which can be more easily explained by stupidity.\nLike Joe Ro
 gan said\; “society has taken all the sharp edges off of life.” While this 
 may not be true for genocide in the congo or warring over opium\, or two so
 cieties bombing a village trying to sit peacefully between two mountains. I
 n America it is definitely true. It is so easy to live in America\, it’s ev
 en written in to our great nation’s history and law. Let me remind you of t
 he second paragraph.\n[Every American has undeniable right to] “Life\, Libe
 rty\, and the pursuit of Happiness.”\nEasy to understand right? Not so. Our
  human nature has a habit of screwing this up\, so let me spell it out. If 
 you want to be miserable\, you still have the right to live and be free. Li
 fe is sustained by physiological needs such as food\, water\, and air to br
 eathe. Arguably\, our generation is entitled to housing and free education\
 , but that remains to be seen.\nEveryone in the world agrees we have it too
  easy\, so we invent drama in our lives to screw up how easy we have it. Dr
 ama such as 50% divorce rates\, spreading disease\, not “taking care of our
 selves”\, arguing about money\, arguing about politics\, arguing about gend
 er versus mental illness.\nManagement 2: Manage them out\nI have to write a
 bout this because it happened to me. This article titled “How to make an em
 ployee quit” pretty much sums it up nicely. Basically\, during a “storming”
  phase\, a manager piles on work until you get stressed enough that you mak
 e mistakes. Instead of appreciating all the great things a person can do\, 
 they focus on the 1 thing you did wrong.\nThe manager gives you bad reviews
 \, threatens to put you on probation. The worst thing they can do is lay yo
 u off because then the employer has to pay a tax penalty. Instead\, they wo
 uld rather incite “insubordination”\; a legal reason to fire someone. Not t
 hat anyone in America could challenge being fired thanks to HRs little lett
 er they send right after you leave saying that you won’t take them to court
 .\nKnow how I know GlassDoor is bullshit? For that reason right there. If p
 eople left a company because of heinous actions and stood up for themselves
  in a courtroom\, companies would be forced to treat humans with respect in
 stead of like a disposable resource they are today. GlassDoor isn’t going t
 o fix that.\nCure: Reputation\nAll of these bad management solutions are co
 mmonly used today. All of them give companies bad reputations. This is why 
 I will never work for a bank like Wells Fargo or a financial institution li
 ke Charles Schwab. I am so entitled that I don’t want to waste your time wi
 th my subpar quality of work. I am so entitled I care about your business s
 aving money by not wasting it on me. Is that really entitlement?\nI have a 
 bad attitude for American business. Maybe because I don’t know where money 
 comes from. Or because over the last 10 years I have witnessed the American
  Ideal (that is\, the best of the best) disappear. Things like\, “money bac
 k guarantee”\, don’t exist anymore. We’d rather not hear from customers at 
 all than face the fact we’ve done something wrong. Or\, the price of health
 care. No amount of insurance is going to fix greed.\n“Americans don’t know 
 how to lose.” — Me\nThis is one angry Republican reminding you to keep payi
 ng your taxes. Republicans hate it when I say that…

DESCRIPTION:\nA tall man\, 6 foot 4 inches\, maybe only 6 foot 2 inches and
  3 quarters\, stands in the doorway. The light is slightly yellow above him
 \, it shines downwards over dark clothing and creates shadows under his hat
  and facial features. He introduces himself to me as a “treasure hunter” as
  if to disguise a violent hatred towards criminals and junkies.\n\nHis shoe
 s sparkle with dulled spikes coming off the ends. One shoe is black and one
  is white. They both have a checkered patterns around the back and the heel
 . He’s dress in a gray tweed style fabric\, Brooks Brothers. His suit looks
  like something out of 19th century victorian London. He is a thin man\, we
 aring tight pants\, but no so tight that I could see exactly how thin he is
 . There are shoulder pads in his suit jacket\, almost as if to make himself
  look larger. I don’t have a problem admitting he’s a good looking man\, no
 t the kind you would expect to hire to hunt someone down. The one thing tha
 t does stick out as normal for this kind of animal is the cryptic tattoos. 
 One is red\, it starts on the neck\, it is round\, but it stretches down un
 der the shirt and I can’t make it out. The other is black\, it’s on his wri
 st. The black tattoo is also round\; circular to be exact. I noticed it whe
 n he shook my hand to introduce himself\, it came out from his sleeve. It h
 ad markings along the edge\, like a clock. But it had twice as many points 
 as a clock\, 24 instead of 12\, and another ring in the inside with 12 poin
 ts. There we no hands in the middle of the circles like there are on a cloc
 k.\nThe thing I’ve lost\nI’m missing a family heirloom. Normally\, I wouldn
 ’t bother getting attached to these types of things. This particular piece 
 was a gift from my wife\, a medal awarded to a pilot family member during t
 he war. To me\, it was a key to another realm. When I hold it\, and close m
 y eyes\, a navy fog pours over my mind. I sink into darkness\, as if I was 
 falling down Alice’s rabbit hole. Then the light opens up from the center\,
  like going through a tunnel in a very fast train. The light streaks throug
 h my mind\, bursting outwardly from the center\, flying past my face on all
  sides. When I reach the other end\, I look down at the world\, like I woul
 d from a plane up in the sky. I am flying around\, but instead of being in 
 the sky\, there is more land\, houses\, cars\, and people\, stretched compl
 etely around inside a giant globe. The sunlight is in the center and veins 
 of light dangle around it outwardly like lightning bolts. It is the opposit
 e of the world I am from\, where sky is on the outside and the ground is in
  the middle. When I open my hand and loosen my grip on the device\, the wor
 ld vanishes like water evaporating into nothingness. I have returned.\nThe 
 heirloom was stolen from me while I was on a business trip\, and I’ve hired
  a bounty hunter to get it back. The tall man is well spoken and polite. He
  asks me a barrage of pointed questions. The kind meant to sting. “Why woul
 d you let someone take something so precious to you?” “Why should I help yo
 u get it back?” I can’t imagine a correct answer\, so I squirm. “I’m not a 
 strong person.” “I’m willing to pay.” I respond.\nThe tall man never gives 
 me a name. As if it is meaningless\, like he expects me to know who he is\,
  not what he is called. I don’t have a phone number\, or contact informatio
 n. He only showed up because I met him in public and asked him to be here o
 n a specific day at a specific time\, and that is exactly what happened. He
  showed up tonight\, at exactly 9 PM.\n“It could take me weeks.” I know. “N
 a zdrovia.” He shakes my hand\, and put his fingers to his hat. He gives a 
 slight nod and takes his leave. He turns and walks towards his vehicle\; it
  is an off-roading powerhouse. Something like a JEEP\, but it looks more li
 ke the kind of car Batman would drive\, completely covered in black armor a
 nd bright flood lights outlining the windshield and sides. The light reflec
 ts off the houses as if it’s day out\, but the sun has gone down hours ago.
  It has a booming rumble when the engine starts\, I’ve never seen anything 
 like it. I shiver from the cold and close the front door. It is late fall.\
 nI am new to this.\nI never thought to hire a bounty hunter before. I’ve lo
 st things. I never intended to kill anyone. I didn’t ask him to kill anyone
 . God\, I hope he doesn’t have to kill someone. Now I’m worried. What if th
 is comes back to me\, what if something happens and he gives up my name? Is
  it illegal to hire someone to kill someone else? I didn’t do anything wron
 g. I can’t sleep.\nIs it strange to break the 4th wall and say\, I’m not a 
 good writer. I only have my personal experiences to draw from\, and very li
 ttle imagination or creativity. Even now\, as I sit in my office at home. I
 ’m at a wooden desk\, it’s designed to look old and stylish\, like somethin
 g a lawyer would sit at with a little green lamp in the middle. But the des
 k is definitely nothing special. No President ever sat at it. It’s not an a
 ntique\, except it tries too hard to look like one. The room is painted a s
 ort of medium red\, it’s far from blood red\, and it’s not quite maroon.\nI
  only did a bit of research on bounty hunters. There’s plenty of classic ma
 terial on the subject. In the 1800s when the western United States was bein
 g developed\, if a criminal was able to get away from the law\, a bounty hu
 nter could track them down. They would take the criminal to the proper auth
 orities and collect a reward. “Dead or alive.” Is a condition where the cri
 minal could be returned in cuffs or a coffin.\nI never thought I’d meet one
  in real life. I guess it is kind of like a free-range detective/police\, o
 r kind of like a former federal agent. I thought of it like a private inves
 tigator\, but more like when the “bounty” is harder to find. A treasure hun
 ter like he said. My lost medal is certainly a treasure to me\, so it makes
  sense.\nThe treasure found\n8 months go by. I’ve almost forgotten I ever h
 ired the bounty hunter. He bangs on my door in the middle of a scorching ho
 t day. It is unusually hot for getting near the end of summer. I open the d
 oor\, and my heirloom is sticking out of his hands right in front of my fac
 e. He holds it out like the trophy it is. He’s won it back. I am ecstatic a
 nd I grab for it only to have it snatched away from again. He clenches it i
 n his fists. “There’s the issue of my fee.” I’ve already paid him $10\,000.
  He told me half up-front for travel and expenses. “You didn’t tell me you 
 were looking for a key.” I’m floored.\nFuck. He’s going to want a much bigg
 er check. I invite him inside. “Where did you find it?” I ask. He saunters 
 over slowly to the kitchen table. He looks around as he walks. He touches t
 hings he passes\, a pen sitting on the table near the front door. A book si
 tting next to it. The frame of a mirror and a picture hanging in the hallwa
 y between the door and the kitchen. His other hand still clenching my heirl
 oom and key.\nHe sits down at the table\, still wearing the gray tweed look
 ing suit and hat\, with a different undershirt. He puts his hand on the tab
 le\, with his wrist and tattoo facing upwards. The tattoo starts to glow re
 d\, then orange\, then a bright white light bursts out of it\, with a holog
 raphic scene appearing above his open and relaxed hand. The scene depicts a
  man in a gray tweed suit walking down a narrow\, raining alleyway.\nIn bri
 lliant light\, like watching a TV\, people brush past him in the alleyway. 
 He comes up behind another man who is hunched over\, looking downwards into
  his hands. He has long gray hair and dark clothing. The bounty hunter\, se
 en from a birds-eye-view\, pulls out a long knife in his right hand. A seco
 nd later the knife runs across the scene from left to right\, like he was d
 rawing a line in the air. But instead of air\, there is blood spraying ever
 ywhere\, and instead of drawing a line\, he’s cutting the elderly man’s thr
 oat.\nI wish I hadn’t seen that. He reaches down\, and picks something shin
 y out of the dead man’s hand. My heirloom. The scene fades\, and the tattoo
  on his wrist dims\, turning red and then black and skin colored again.\n“Y
 ou didn’t tell me you had a key.” He repeated.

DESCRIPTION:\nI pace nervously back and forth across the kitchen. It is a s
 mall room\, with a two person table\, a sink\, one of those under-sized ref
 rigerators meant to squeeze retrofitted into small places. A window over th
 e kitchen sink\, with impossible stains on the glass\, clouding it. The pai
 nt around every corner of the house has barely started to peel away\, the h
 ot humid summers and freezing humid winters slowly rot away at every crack 
 and corner of the old wooden and brick house. Normal maintenance.\n\nMy wif
 e comes in from picking a few leaves of mint from a little patio garden pla
 nter. She left the back door open\, so she knows our guest is here. “Would 
 you like tea?” she asks. She pour a cup\, the boiler is almost always runni
 ng. Hot tea on a hot day. It does make you feel cooler after you finish dri
 nking it. She hovers over me and puts her hands firmly on my chest. Below t
 he collar bone\, at the top of my ribs. This is where Ego lives on the body
 . She holds me down\, as if I might float away if it wasn’t for her grip.\n
 “You’re taking me with you.” the man announces to both of us. Still firmly 
 gripping my precious medal. “The last time I saw one of these was 1943.” he
  proclaims like a performing magician. How is this possible? The man looks 
 like he’s in his mid 30s\, but that would mean he’s over 80 years old. “I h
 aven’t been back since before the Surrealist shit you out.” my wife respond
 s. I turn to look in her eyes. “You the ones he shit out\,” he responded sn
 arkily\, and smiled.\n“You two already know each other?” I asked. I mean\, 
 it’s the most relevant thing I could think of to ask\, since I have no clue
  about whatever else is being discussed. I never thought my wife was over 1
 00 years old. I thought she was only 3 years older than me. “When I hold th
 e medal\, I see another world\, but when I let it go it disappears.” I try 
 to explain. Admittedly\, I’m ashamed\, they know more about it than me.\n“T
 hat’s because you haven’t been accepted.” What does that mean? The tall man
  looks me directly in the eyes. “You’re a bad person.” He tells me. I sit s
 ilent and he puts the medal on the table in front of me. My wife is still h
 olding her hands on my chest\, but she pushed me down even more. I reach fo
 r my beloved gift and gently tip it over on the table with the tips of my f
 ingers. I shed a tear\, from the right eye and then the left. I cried. The 
 two tears drip off my cheek and leave a small circle imprinted on my shirt.
  You’d never be able to tell if it was a tear or sweat from the hot day.\n“
 That is not what we were sent here for.” My wife says with a scolding tone 
 towards the gentleman. He seems less gentlemanly now\, more cruel\, and eve
 n more withholding of truth. My mind races.\nThe disappearing act\nThe man 
 never asks for another payment. He stands quietly and buttons the top butto
 n of his sports coat. He walks towards the front door. My wife releases my 
 Ego from her grip and follows him back down the hallway. They speak quietly
  for only a few seconds. “He’s almost ready.” I overheard\, the door opens 
 and shuts and the man is gone.\nMy wife walks quietly back to the kitchen w
 here I am still sitting. She runs her hand along my shoulders and then sits
  down where the bounty hunter sat. She frowns\, but then smiles and leans o
 ver for a kiss on the lips. “Try not to think about it too much\, it has dr
 iven some men crazy.”\nWe go about our lives. We’ve hidden the heirloom in 
 a drawer next to the bed. It’s nearly forgotten. My wife carries it with he
 r when we travel. I rarely ever see it. And I’ve never held it again and le
 t myself drift into some imaginary world that might be too real. Not since 
 I met the bounty hunter. Years pass. We have a son.\nLife races by. I fall 
 asleep one day and wake up 10 years older it seems. Like everything around 
 me travels at the speed of light\, but I am alone. My wife rushes from one 
 responsibility to the next\, tending to me\, our son\, our friends. She’s h
 appy\, or at least the makes herself appear happy in front of everyone. Som
 etimes we watch a movie together and I see her cry\, as if there was some p
 ersonal connection with the people in the movie. I retract from daily life.
  Seeing how quickly it rushes past makes me depressed.\nOne day I am lookin
 g myself in the mirror\, and my hair is turning gray. My wife on the other 
 hand doesn’t look a day older than the day we met. She colors her hair and 
 plays with her appearance over the years\, but her skin stays the same. She
  is always glowing and youthful.\nOur son grows\, he goes to school every d
 ay\, and summer camp in between school seasons. I get to watch him grow and
  it brings a tear to my eyes to think about because one day everything is g
 one and my world is turned upside down. We’re in the grocery store\, like w
 e are every week when it happens. I watch my wife and son walk down the ais
 le\, and I follow only 10 steps behind them. When I turn the corner they ar
 e both gone.\nI search for them frantically. I look at the time\, and I’ve 
 been searching for an hour already. I go to customer service\, and ask them
  to announce their names at the desk. “Did you drive here the lady asks?” Y
 es. The car is still in the parking lot. I checked. I return to the counter
  and no one has showed up.\nBounty hunter returned\nI’m devastated. A day g
 oes by. I file a police report for two missing people. My wife and child ar
 e gone. I haven’t stopped crying since I left the grocery store yesterday.\
 nA week goes by and I’m losing it. I feel my mind deteriorating. My heart f
 eels like a thousand ton anvil. I haven’t bathed\, or shaved my face. I hav
 en’t eaten. I lay on the kitchen floor. The place we used to make breakfast
  for our baby every day. I am balling\, laying in a puddle of my own tears.
  I’m shaking. It hurts to move. My chest is in so much pain\, my arms and l
 egs feel numb. I vomit again. I feel like dying.\nI hear a forceful poundin
 g on the door. This is it. I’m going to be arrested for being a suspect for
  the murder of my wife\, I thought. I’ll be killed. God\, with any luck som
 eone will smash my head in and take me out of this world. My miserable exis
 tence\, reduced to nothing. I have nothing else to lose but my own consciou
 sness.\nThe bounty hunter kicks my door down. The wood around the latch sha
 tters and tears in half like snapping a toothpick in half. The hinges fall 
 off and the door slams on the ground. The adrenaline rushing through my vei
 ns and I try to pull myself off the ground by pulling a handle on the cupbo
 ard. I put my hand on the top of the counter and try to pull myself up. I s
 ee down the hall and the bounty hunter rushes towards me.\nHe pulls me into
  a standing position\, like I was a small child. He’s a giant compared to m
 e\, and I am a frail feather to him. Like a bottle of water\, he lifts me u
 p to his face as if he’s going to take a drink out of me. “Pull your shit t
 ogether man.” He says\, entirely unsympathetically. “Your wife isn’t gone\,
  she’s just gone home.” These words sit with me as I continue crying. He si
 ts my down in a chair at the table and I slouch against the wall. I can bar
 ely hold myself up. I am weak\, dehydrated\, malnourished. I can barely thi
 nk enough to drink the cup of tea he puts in front of me.\nThe bounty hunte
 r smirks\; he doesn’t smile.\nhttps://medium.com/@proverbs12eight/bounty-hu

DESCRIPTION:\nI drink my tea slowly\, having not eaten in a week\, I still 
 feel sick. My stomach turns in knots. “You still have the key right?” the b
 ounty hunter asks. I had to think about it. I haven’t seen it in years. My 
 wife always keeps it with her. I remember the bedside table. The tears stop
 . It feels like an entire universe has opened inside my head.\nI shake as I
  try to lift myself out of the chair. I stumble towards the bedroom. “Entit
 led\, selfish\, egotistical\, narcissistic\, greedy…” the man continues\, I
  can hear him from the other room. I guess we wouldn’t get along very well.
  I find the heirloom in the drawer. Wings\, like an eagle\, extending from 
 a round piece with various shapes in the middle. “…drug addicted\, alcoholi
 c\, junkie. This is exactly why she didn’t take you with her. You weigh too
  much in our world of light.” He yells. I sit down and frantically squeeze 
 the device in my hand.\nI sink into darkness\, and the light starts to rush
  past me. The other world opens\, and I see her face. She’s with my son out
 side in what looks like a park. She looks up at me\, directly in to my eyes
  and smiles. I see a tear\, the kind of tears when we watch romantic comedi
 es together. My wife looks older now. She only ages in her home world. I ca
 n see her hair graying\, and she would kill me for saying so\, but the most
  gentle of lines around her face give her a well educated and strict look. 
 Like you might expect from your favorite school teacher.\nI feel a scalding
  hot pain on my hand. I scream and lose my grip on the medal. I open my eye
 s and the bounty hunter is pouring the pot of boiling water on my fist. “Th
 at’s what it feels like living in this world with you.” “You laying here cr
 ying and whimpering to yourself while the rest of the world forgets about y
 ou.” “When you on the other side\, over there…” he continues on as if I lac
 k some theoretical foundation of description. How do you explain a basketba
 ll to a circle? How do you explain time to something that only exists for a
  split moment? “You’re royalty.”\nA world revealed\n“There’s only person th
 e council has spoken to in the last century\, a pilot. He was sent back.” I
 ’ve read the folk-lore\, but that’s all I thought it was. Even now as I wri
 te about\, I am old. I feel like I’ve lived 10 lives. The bounty hunter spe
 nds the day explaining to me how there aren’t infinite realities like the m
 ultiverse. That is bullshit.\nThere are currently only 2 realities occupyin
 g the same temporal space. The same timeline we experience\, is the exact s
 ame timeline the inner world experiences. Our worlds are connected by the s
 ame exact space in time. Our worlds occupy different physical spaces. We ex
 perience the world as solid matter\, they aren’t confined to exist in solid
  matter. The world I know was created by the council as a shield for their 
 world. It’s like the protective wrapping\, and the Surrealist is the candy 
 center.\nThe Surrealist decides which parts of reality are forced into the 
 world I know. The inner reality\, that I have a key for\, has a much longer
  history. On Earth\, we think of history as fragmented. We know people exis
 ted a million years ago\, but we can’t prove exactly where. We know about a
  long history in Asia and Africa\, and there are cave drawings and language
 s that are thousands of years old. And we go back 5 to 10 thousand years an
 d we have a pretty good record of the societies that exist such as ancient 
 Greece and eventually the Roman empire a few thousand years ago. And of cou
 rse lots of history and photos of 2 world wars in the last century.\nThe ot
 her world\, the bounty hunter explain\, is the world of light. They maintai
 n history for billions of years. They have millions of years of human inter
 action and knowledge to draw from. They understand every intricacy of the h
 uman gene\, which is just a partial representation of our existence forced 
 into this confined reality by the Surrealist.\nThe Surrealist has forced wa
 r into our reality. This is why beings like the bounty hunter and my wife w
 ere sent. The Surrealist pushed to hard\, and our reality turned to shit. T
 he council was the only force that could intervene with the Surrealist\, bu
 t they waited too long to make a decision. When they realized their mistake
 \, they intercepted a pilot that was flying near the arctic pole. They gave
  him a message. “Stop your wars or both our worlds will be destroyed.”

DESCRIPTION:---\ntitle: The perfect interview and how to mess it up\npublis
 hed: true\ndescription: Drawing from a lot of personal experience. I've int
 erviewed with dozens of companies\, and been rejected by dozens more.\ntags
 : interview\, technology\, failure\ncover_image: https://thepracticaldev.s3
 .amazonaws.com/i/0rq6mox7etlvq2j9l6ze.jpg\n---\n\nAhh\, the beautiful city 
 of San Francisco. The most advanced city in the world has some of the weird
 est problems. But that isn't what this article is about. It's about an inte
 rview I had.\n\nImagine the perfect job opportunity\, coming at you out of 
 the blue from cyberspace:\n```\nHi Brian\,\n\nMy name is REDACTED\, and I a
 m CEO of REDACTED.\nWe are working on some really interesting problems in t
 he behavioral finance space.\nWe just got a series B funding and are lookin
 g to expand our team.\nWould you be open to having a short chat?\n```\n\nWo
 w! That was friendly. It's taken me a long time to appreciate the honesty i
 n this introduction. It only took me a short time to screw it up.\n\n```\nH
 i REDACTED!\n\nI'd love to have a chat about this\,\nespecially since I've 
 behaved badly financially\,\nand I'm attending a Dave Ramsey course.\n\nI'v
 e attached my resume.\n```\n\nI just started learning NodeJS at the time. T
 he second technical interview\, the guy walked me through various pieces of
  their platform\, and I was able to spot and correct a bug on a stack I had
  never used before\, including the adding the proper Unit Test for it.\n\n#
 # The dream city of San Francisco\n\nI invited my wife to go with me. Our p
 lan was to ditch the flight home and stay a few days after the interview. O
 f course we took a Cable Car around town. But that was after the interview.
 \n\n![Alt Text](https://thepracticaldev.s3.amazonaws.com/i/yzs7bi1wzkb59m3x
 dj9x.jpg)\n\nWe arrived from the airport and I had scheduled a black town c
 ar to take us downtown. Their office was in the financial district.\n\nWhen
  I got to the office\, it was open-concept. It was pretty quiet\, but all t
 he desks were in one room facing each other. A few offices on the side. We 
 started the interview\, it was about 10 AM but I had been traveling all mor
 ning\, hadn't eaten\, and already feeling like a clown wearing a tie when e
 veryone else was in t-shirt and shorts.\n\nI thought I was being cool weari
 ng a suit and tie. I thought\, I am ready to squash some bugs\, like this g
 uy:\n\n![Alt Text](https://thepracticaldev.s3.amazonaws.com/i/ml04v5zjhdsc4
 3cqbmy1.png)\n\nI tried to connect to the internet. I later realized that i
 t wasn't their WiFi blocking me\, it was because I had custom DNS settings\
 , set to Google's public DNS. The interviewer let me use his phone's connec
 tion. Why should I spend data in the interview? It's their office. The phon
 e kept shutting off\, and my internet died.\n\nNeedless to say\, using a pl
 atform I was completely new to\, without internet. I beefed the interview. 
 That means I didn't do well. And my failures were on display to the entire 
 company contained in their single office.\n\nI was invited in to the adjace
 nt office for the second part of the interview. It was about marketing and 
 Airbnb. Or so I thought. They showed me a page where Airbnb's video failed 
 to load. I suggested the fix was to use an automated test for every device.
  I should have just plugged the tablet in to my computer and looked at whic
 h transcoding the video used\, tried to stream it myself\, and then use AWS
  Elastic Transcoder (cloud VLC server?) to convert the video and play it on
  the iPad. Problem solved.\n\nSomething tells me that wasn't the point of t
 he interview.\n\nWe eventually sat down for lunch. It was salad. I can't sa
 y I was overjoyed. But I did appreciate the company fulfilling my physiolog
 ical needs in exchange for work. If this was a regular thing\, daily for th
 is company\, I could definitely make myself happy here.\n\nThis is when thi
 ngs got weird. I started asking some of the other employees what their `fun
 ction()` is. One employee explained he works in iOS. Which I thought was st
 range\, because my soon to be passive-aggressive middle manager just told m
 e "everyone here is full stack." Wishful thinking I guess.\n\n```\n"Everyth
 ing is a waste of time."\n```\n\nIf I ever have an interview again\; don't 
 say this people. It didn't turn out well.  In fact\, it makes me look insan
 e. Let's take a look inside Brian's brain!\n\n![Alt Text](https://thepracti
 caldev.s3.amazonaws.com/i/uzjyd4a5yeqytp0096ua.png)\n\nMoment later\, the C
 EO of the company invited me in to the side office. He asked how my other i
 nterviews are going. He told me "we don't really have the funds to 'raise' 
 you. We can't afford to make any mistakes." Then he asked me to leave.\n\nI
  never really recovered from that experience. I thought\, this is the same 
 feeling I had in high school when I was being bullied. It's the same feelin
 g I had at the previous company before I was laid off. It's the same feelin
 g I had at the company before that when I was accused of saying things I ne
 ver said.\n\nIt's the feeling of not being good enough for something\, and 
 being judged for it. Maybe it's the feeling of shame.\n\n## Well\, jokes on
  them.\n\nBecause the statement of "everything is a waste of time" is the c
 ore foundation of mine and many philosophies that have existed thousands of
  years longer than this tech company. It is in my core as a process improve
 r. In the old testament\, we have Ecclesiastes:\n\n```\n"Meaningless! Meani
 ngless!"\n    says the Teacher.\n"Utterly meaningless!\n    Everything is m
 eaningless."\n```\n\nIn TAO\, we have the concept of non-change and non-act
 ion. Where everything that exists must have a period of non-existence. Ever
 ything that is built can and probably will be destroyed.\n\nIn Hinduism\, I
  particularly like the introduction to the Saṁyutta Nikāya:\n\n```\n"I cros
 sed over the flood without pushing forward\, without staying in place."\n``
 `\n\nPretty much describes my life as a programmer perfectly.\n\nIn technol
 ogy\, we see "life-cycles" all the time. Old technology is replaced for new
  technology and there is very little concern as to where the old technology
  ends up. I have a dozen broken phones in a bucket in my garage. The CEOs o
 f the companies that manufactured them don't care.\n\nProcess improvement i
 s simple. Do a little brainstorming! Make a list of 10 things you like most
  about your job. Then make a list of 10 things that you find are bothersome
 \, annoying\, take too much time\, not fun. Then\, and here's the kicker\; 
 stop doing those 10 things you don't like. Some people stop doing them\, an
 d hire interns to do them instead. If you are the intern\, your job will ma
 ke you miserable and you aren't going to feel fulfilled. When that happens\
 , the quality of work becomes so low\, it's not really worth it for the com
 pany to pay you to do it. Or you are giving up your health\, which isn't wo
 rth it for the company\, or their insurance policy. If you stop doing those
  10 you don't like\, the company will probably keep chugging along.\n\n## C
 losing thoughts\n\n![Alt Text](https://thepracticaldev.s3.amazonaws.com/i/v
 iopyz6e9bo3t92f1px1.jpg)\n\nYou're all a part of my life-long experiment of
  my own personal **illusion of asymmetric insight**. I love to be proven wr
 ong. I love to wonder about my own significance and insignificance. Maybe\,
  I have too much time to think on my hands. What would ever come of a Co-fo
 under of a blog liking my article? \;)\n\nI might never find answers to the
 se questions I have. But I am glad I have the capacity to pontificate them.
  And I am thankful I have a place to write them down. I am reading the book
  Fluke. But I can't help but wonder\, in a world with seemingly impossibly 
 complex systems\, is there even a curtain to look behind?\n\nhttps://www.am

DESCRIPTION:When a merchant takes money it is immediate but returning money
  from a mistake takes 14 business days\n\nBeing expected to know my exact n
 et worth every second at every purchase when Dark design would trick me in 
 to signing up for things\, or being charged after a forgotten trial period.
  People with these kind of expectations don't even know what day their Netf
 lix subscription charges but they think I should because I'm stupid and poo
 r.\n\nWhen I have a problem\, the court refuses to help but when a bank has
  a problem people come knocking on my door from the court.\n\nIf I have to 
 sue someone I have to hire a lawyer or my limit is $10\,000 justice of the 
 peace. When a company sues someone they have power\, money\, and lawyers an
 d no limit to how much they can damage my estate. Complete lack of jurispru
 dence.

DESCRIPTION:Recruiters abuse their power of massive communication and being
  impersonal\, people get pissed off and the most qualified and talented peo
 ple are rarely hired that way.\n\nPoliticians like Jaime abuse power and ci
 tizens are forced to find new ways to hide their money/assets.\n\nParadoxes
  are like when you take a colloquialism such as "when it rains it pours" bu
 t the opposite causes it.\nE.g. you go on a date and suddenly 3 other peopl
 e try to ask you out. Caused by other people breaking up\, or a 4x lack of 
 dates somewhere else.\n\nIf I don't own anything\, nothing can be taken awa
 y. Jeff Bezos is rich and powerful because he doesn't abuse it.\n\nIndividu
 al contributor is the opposite of passive income.\n\nPornography and divorc
 e causes all shitty behavior?\n\nPeople's morality is literally affected by
  media and other stress.\n\nCompany policy\, food quality are also subjecte
 d to creative destruction.

DESCRIPTION:I check my own pulse. It's kind of like pinching yourself to se
 e if you're dreaming. I put my fingers up to the side of my throat just to 
 feel the slight pulsation of millions of cells pumping through my body. I d
 o this to make sure I'm still alive and not trapped inside my own mind. In 
 3030\, a person can't be too careful\, when it comes to being doxed.\n\nCor
 e concepts:\nEverything has already been done - Mr Nobody and Stanley Kubri
 ck - Death of Originality Fredrick Jameson\nMoral dilemma - you discover a 
 technology that could change a person for the better/happier/healthier but 
 they have to give up free will and submit to the system\nShadow government 
 - Not the kind of machiavellian scheming\, the kind of disinformation going
  on for thousands of years in the pursuit of immortality/godliness\nA proce
 ss for becoming all knowing\, immortality leads to not existing in the curr
 ent reality anymore\, but rather traveling through time at a different pace
  than everyone else\, like some depictions of Dracula or Wolverine\nBrain d
 oxing - like the Brainalyzer from Rick and Morty\, but anyone can do it to 
 anyone else\n\nHow would it be possible to know everything? You would have 
 to travel through history. verify that what you have learned is correct. Ti
 me-travel isn't possible\, but if history repeated itself and you aren't co
 nstrained by life and death\, would you eventually know everything?

DESCRIPTION:Introduction<br><br>I have been thinking along these lines for 
 a while. I was inspired\, but it didn't start then\, when I first attended 
 Impact Church it happened to be the sermon on "The End of Days". The Pastor
  explained how there are signs in our current reality (2016) that match the
  visions of John written in Revelation. This is a well studied topic called
 &nbsp\;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preterism">https://en.wikiped
 ia.org/wiki/Preterism</a>. The idea that the events in Revelation already h
 appened (or are currently happening). However\, this is not the point. In t
 his abstract\, I focus on 2 assumptions:<br><br>1) The bible is still relev
 ant today\, just like it always is\, giving Preterism some logical legitima
 cy in that\, the worlds unmaking doesn't specify any sort of time frame. In
  fact\, it specifies that we can't possibly know when the Rapture starts.<b
 r>2) The bible is backwards. If Revelation (aka Realization of Truth) is ha
 ppening now\, then Genesis is the real end and it describes the order the w
 orld will be unmade.<br><br>Mathematical proof of Jesus' second coming<br><
 br>I was in San Francisco applying for a job when my friend showed me a vid
 eo called\, "How a mathematician dissects a coincides". What are the chance
 s a person working in technology would come across this video on their YouT
 ube feed? There is probably a number for this. I bought the author's book b
 ut this was long after I already started believing in the possibility that 
 there is no such thing as coincidence. There is a mathematical explanation 
 for every occurrence\, like John Nash. The problem is\, until recently\, we
  haven't had the technology to piece together millions of chance occurrence
 s that lead us to be surprised by coincidences.<br><br>In the book Fluke\, 
 the author explains how we look for a greater than even chance of something
  occurring. Better than 50/50 odds\, and 1 to 1 odds is "certainty" that it
  will happen. I discusses how odds are compounded\, and how some chances ca
 n't be measured because we simple don't have the means to record the inform
 ation.<br><br>Assuming the first condition is true\, and the bible is still
  relevant. If there is a perfect being among us\, they would need to learn 
 every life lesson Jesus taught in order to be righteous. Jesus teaches abou
 t 100 lessons\, but we focus on 24 Parables. We assume that the order of le
 ssons learnt matters\, even if we don't know thats 100% true. It's the way 
 it is written after all. That is the factorial of 24! Those are the chances
  that a single person will learn each life lesson and all life lessons will
  be learned one after another. Or 620448401733239439360000. Here is the inc
 alculable part. How do you measure which of these lessons people have learn
 ed\, and how is possible to measure every person in the world if you are lo
 oking for an exact match?<br><br>Lets assume there is no possibility that a
  person could live all 24 life lessons and never mis-step. We divide that n
 umber by 24. Then we divide again by 14 billion people in the world by the 
 year 2200. We get 1.8465726e+12.&nbsp\; That's not even close to probable. 
 What if instead of 14 billion current earth residence\, we divide by the nu
 mber of people in human existence by the 2050. That's 228554773409. At leas
 t we are out of the exponents.<br><br>Predicting the future assuming the bi
 ble is backwards<br><br>I've been a long believer that sometimes\, a lesson
  is explained in the bible not as an example of what you should do\, but in
 stead an example of what you should NOT do in life. We call it "The Good Bo
 ok"\, but there are dozens of horrifyingly dark stories.<br><br>The laws of
  physics states that every action has an equal and opposite reaction. There
  are two ways I like to approach this. 1) The old testament God is vengeful
  and uses punishment. 2) What the verse is describing is the opposite of wh
 at is true\, i.e. we have to acknowledge the bad\, in order to make it righ
 t\, i.e. the "Never Again" attitude.<br><br>Let's go over some examples tha
 t I was given in the Revelation sermon and some that I have come up with on
  my own.<br><br><br><br>Basis for a moral video game<br><br>When we think a
 bout how "The Bible is still relevant today"\, we try\, and pastors try\, t
 o relate the experience from 2000 years ago to situations in people's lives
  today. Video games are fun because we get to relate to a situation that we
  might not act out in real life. Tons of theologians have researched the po
 ssible proving of Jesus' super natural powers. For example:<br><br>- Matt 9
 \, Mark 8\, John 9 - Jesus heals the blind man in the temple. We scientists
  liken this event to Dissociation disorder causing blindness. A known illne
 ss that has been around for thousands of years. We even see Rasputin in an 
 episode of "The Last Tsars" apparently curing a blind man of Parkinson’s by
  only using his hands and words. We also like to imagine that during Jesus'
  14 undocumented years growing up that he travels to China. The procedure f
 or cathartic foggy eye lens involves flushing the eye with blood using a ne
 edle\, and has been known for thousands of years.<br><br>This same kind of 
 mental masturbation can be applied to the old testament as well.<br>- The T
 ower of Babel is apparently a tech company sky scraper like Amazon\, Seattl
 e. But rather than confusing the world\, God reverses his actions\, and com
 munication problems are solved using an AI God.&nbsp\;<a href="https://www.

DESCRIPTION:Didn't go to counseling sooner because Dave Ramsey's theory suc
 ks. - thought I couldn't afford it.\n1) If I waste my life in the pursuit o
 f step 6\, why not start there?  Rich dad - step dad.  The tyranny of money
  management prevents people from just focusing on how they can help others.
   Steve refuses to pursue step 6.  (Thought step six was create opportunity
  for others by valuing their effort and pursuing your own ambitions to the 
 truest extent).  Jim started his life with step 6.  Why start the process a
 t all if you don't intend on finishing it?  What kind of hell is Steve faci
 ng to make him act this way?  Have I created this hell for him?  Can't trus
 t him NOT to try and change all the things I don't know how.\n2) Felt mysel
 f make a driving mistake because I was feeling emotional.  I appreciate Ste
 phen's pursuit. - Ask Jim for a Tesla because I believe in their goals.  Gi
 ve my cars back to the dealerships for not providing safety sensors sooner.
   Refuse to accept payment to perpetuate an accounting mess for them.\n3) I
 nvite Jeff out to lunch to ask what's relevant.  Talk about some lifestyle 
 observations\, smoking\, obesity\, food being more social\, things my Iga t
 aught me. - Must fix my lifestyle first?\n4) Go back to therapy\, try to un
 derstand why I refuse to change even though it hurts me.  Why do people see
 k instant gratification\, why when I stopped\, I became more attracted to I
 ga.  I've acted like a sexual predator and have a lot to repay here.  Stand
 ing up for whores?  Because I know deep down they aren't.  Share some of Ma
 rlise's work with PCS. - Accountability change\, \n\n6) Enjoy lunch with Ke
 ith - Use feature branching like Phil taught me because it will be importan
 t to his outcome.\n7) Defeat IQ test to see if I can prove Flynn effect onl
 y takes 8 years instead of 10?\n8) Don't trust the system even though it wo
 rked on me?  Why did Iga's cousin and Leo quit deity?\n9) If I struggle wit
 h empathy from others and demonstrate that compassion\, they will share my 
 ambitions?\n10) Management instead of law is why Trump is elected.  Possibl
 e ways to help government?  Stephen and Phil shield my ambitions from being
  mismanaged.\n11) Killed my cat that I loved because Keifer told me animals
  don't have eternal souls\, I didn't see the consequence?  Admitted to this
 \, created the feedback loop of accountability.  Someone said to me "well a
 t least I didn't kill any cats" at Enzo's birthday party.  How does this re
 late to rocks having consciousness?  I can't believe animals don't have sou
 ls if that is true. - When people are on the other side\, they have the opt
 ion to choose how to help people on this side\, they can take the form of w
 hatever animal or thing they want to help create the change we all agree on
 .\n12) Why does god think his philosophy is better than everyone else's?\n1
 3) Atlas Shrugged key to helping government?\n14) Read Maxwell all the way 
 through.

DESCRIPTION:\n\nI was shooting heroin and reading “The Fountainhead” in the
  front seat of my privately owned police cruiser when a call came in. I put
  a quarter in the radio to activate it. It was the chief.\n\n“Bad news\, de
 tective. We got a situation.”\n\n“What? Is the mayor trying to ban trans fa
 ts again?”\n\n“Worse. Somebody just stole four hundred and forty-seven mill
 ion dollars’ worth of bitcoins.”\n\nThe heroin needle practically fell out 
 of my arm. “What kind of monster would do something like that? Bitcoins are
  the ultimate currency: virtual\, anonymous\, stateless. They represent tru
 e economic freedom\, not subject to arbitrary manipulation by any governmen
 t. Do we have any leads?”\n\n“Not yet. But mark my words: we’re going to fi
 gure out who did this and we’re going to take them down … provided someone 
 pays us a fair market rate to do so.”\n\n“Easy\, chief\,” I said. “Any rate
  the market offers is\, by definition\, fair.”\n\nHe laughed. “That’s why y
 ou’re the best I got\, Lisowski. Now you get out there and find those bitco
 ins.”\n\n“Don’t worry\,” I said. “I’m on it.”\n\nI put a quarter in the sir
 en. Ten minutes later\, I was on the scene. It was a normal office building
 \, strangled on all sides by public sidewalks. I hopped over them and went 
 inside.\n\n“Home Depot™ Presents the Police!®” I said\, flashing my badge a
 nd my gun and a small picture of Ron Paul. “Nobody move unless you want to!
 ” They didn’t.\n\n“Now\, which one of you punks is going to pay me to inves
 tigate this crime?” No one spoke up.\n\n“Come on\,” I said. “Don’t you all 
 understand that the protection of private property is the foundation of all
  personal liberty?”\n\nIt didn’t seem like they did.\n\n“Seriously\, guys. 
 Without a strong economic motivator\, I’m just going to stand here and not 
 solve this case. Cash is fine\, but I prefer being paid in gold bullion or 
 autographed Penn Jillette posters.”\n\nNothing. These people were stonewall
 ing me. It almost seemed like they didn’t care that a fortune in computer m
 oney invented to buy drugs was missing.\n\nI figured I could wait them out.
  I lit several cigarettes indoors. A pregnant lady coughed\, and I told her
  that secondhand smoke is a myth. Just then\, a man in glasses made a break
  for it.\n\n“Subway™ Eat Fresh and Freeze\, Scumbag!®” I yelled.\n\nToo lat
 e. He was already out the front door. I went after him.\n\n“Stop right ther
 e!” I yelled as I ran. He was faster than me because I always try to avoid 
 stepping on public sidewalks.\n\nOur country needs a private-sidewalk vouch
 er system\, but\, thanks to the incestuous interplay between our corrupt fe
 deral government and the public-sidewalk lobby\, it will never happen.\n\nI
  was losing him. “Listen\, I’ll pay you to stop!” I yelled. “What would you
  consider an appropriate price point for stopping? I’ll offer you a thirtee
 nth of an ounce of gold and a gently worn ‘Bob Barr ‘08’ extra-large long-s
 leeved men’s T-shirt!”\n\nHe turned. In his hand was a revolver that the Co
 nstitution said he had every right to own. He fired at me and missed. I pul
 led my own gun\, put a quarter in it\, and fired back. The bullet lodged in
  a U.S.P.S. mailbox less than a foot from his head. I shot the mailbox agai
 n\, on purpose.\n\n“All right\, all right!” the man yelled\, throwing down 
 his weapon. “I give up\, cop! I confess: I took the bitcoins.”\n\n“Why’d yo
 u do it?” I asked\, as I slapped a pair of Oikos™ Greek Yogurt Presents Han
 dcuffs® on the guy.\n\n“Because I was afraid.”\n\n“Afraid?”\n\n“Afraid of a
 n economic future free from the pernicious meddling of central bankers\,” h
 e said. “I’m a central banker.”\n\nI wanted to coldcock the guy. Years ago\
 , a central banker killed my partner. Instead\, I shook my head.\n\n“Let th
 is be a message to all your central-banker friends out on the street\,” I s
 aid. “No matter how many bitcoins you steal\, you’ll never take away the dr
 eam of an open society based on the principles of personal and economic fre
 edom.”\n\nHe nodded\, because he knew I was right. Then he swiped his credi
 t card to pay me for arresting him.

DESCRIPTION:Thank you for sharing\, I'm excited for his new works. I've bee
 n working on this hypothesis for a while. Let's assume we can draw a line b
 etween rich and poor at 1 million dollars. No matter what age a person is\,
  I've always thought that is a lot of money\, almost an unachievable amount
  but if a person makes over $100k for 10 years they will have spent or save
 d about $1million. We talk about an economic divide\, there is a growing po
 pulation of people that will never have a million dollars\, this population
  is "the poor" or "the 99%" and there is a smaller and smaller population o
 f rich\, people who have at least a million. \n\nHere's the theory\, this a
 pplies to money\, but it also applies to the economy of housing\, there are
  fewer houses that poor people can afford. It applies to education there is
  less education that people can afford and an intellectual elite\, i.e the 
 1% of smartest people on the world. The armed and disarmed\, there are a fe
 w people with lots of guns and many people with no self defense. Health\, t
 here are a few old people who are healthy who don't drink or do drugs and l
 ots of people who are completely unhealthy\, know little about diet and var
 iety and have weight related illness. Which side of all these lines do you 
 find yourself on? That is the constant question.

DESCRIPTION:As a part of a new series I'll be writing my professional opini
 on on legal matters.\n\nA case that started over a decade ago concerning co
 pyright infringement. Google vs Oracle is an unprecedented case that seeks 
 to undermine all of open-source. It also undermines a governing body that p
 reviously undermines all American ingenuity\, called the United States Pate
 nt and Trademark Office (USPTO).\n\nThere is at least a few legitimate use 
 cases for copyright laws. In the case of Disney's Mickey mouse trademark. A
  little history\, Mickey mouse was designed and invented by another person 
 and stolen by Disney. Disney then lobbied for the USPTO to give them exclud
 ing rights to all creative works for over 70 years. Disney is the perfect c
 ase study of both how the USPTO protects intellectual property and how it o
 verreached and creates a monolopy on creativity. But worse is the stigmatis
 ms that they have created within industry\, where "rights" are no longer a 
 logical argument\, but instead a philosophical argument of right versus wro
 ng.\n\nCopyright infringement is a strict liability law which means it does
 n't need proof of "ill intent" or "mens rae" (Latin for guilty conscience).
  This means that no body actually has to be hurt by a copyright infringemen
 t\, they don't have to prove they were hurt by it\, it is inherently wrong 
 because we as a society decided it's wrong.\n\nHere is the depressing part 
 from my field of software engineering. People care more about words  in a s
 ervice license agreement than they do about something working correctly. Sp
 ecifically\, when it comes to open source licensing.\n\nOpen source\, usual
 ly means that anybody can look up a product\, understand the internal worki
 ngs of the product\, AND most excitingly\, make changes to the product to i
 mprove some functionality. Where this gets messy is\, every product has its
  own governing body\, whether it is one person who works on the project (li
 ke a dictatorship) or many people who work on a product (like an oligarchy)
 . Every product can have one or many licenses attached to it with many diff
 erent stipulations such as\, "all uses of this product must also be open so
 urce". Here's the tricky part\, some stipulations for open source prohibit 
 certain uses of the product. You can literally put anything in a license\, 
 such as "this product may only be used during a full moon." And everyone ha
 s to abide by those rules\, no matter if they are not REALLY enforceable. A
 nd believe me\, there are some really stupid rules out there.\n\nThe unfort
 unate part is this stifles American ingenuity\, to the highest degree. I ha
 ve had people tell me "NOT to use a feature because it uses License A inste
 ad of License B". The fact is\, the work has already been done\, but I am d
 isallowed by me peers and whatever fading ethical alignment I have with the
  industry. I am unable\, and even\, ejected from a creative pursuit because
  of words on a page.\n\nThis is not to say I have zero respect for copyrigh
 t. I do have respect. My issue is with utility. What utility does something
  have if both Product A and Product B are limited\, but together could be t
 ransformed in to a great New Product. This is not the intent of any patent 
 law whatsoever in the entire history of intellectual property.\n\nIntellect
 ual property has been around since ancient Greek democracy. Thousands of ye
 ars ago the design of a woven basket was granted exclusive rights to a sell
 er so that they might be the only person in town selling this style basket.
  In recent years\, intellectual property has only been addressed since the 
 1700s with the design of a ____.\n\nIn even more recent years\, the cinemat
 ized story of a man who invented the windshield wipers. Who the hell wants 
 to spend his entire life and all their time and energy arguing about their 
 invention that they never got paid for?\n\nThe point of all this history is
  to say\, copyright laws\, like most laws are intended to protect the lesse
 r privileged and the people who could be hurt by people breaking them. They
  should be written and implemented to protect people\, not the rich and pow
 erful.\n\nThere are many other examples of deficiencies with copyright laws
 \, such as it's failure to protect content creators. A TV show ripped a cov
 er/remake from a YouTuber. An artists story of a frog became an icon for pe
 dophilia. Even domain name squatting has seen little improvement for tradem
 ark holders.\n\nIn software specifically\, there are examples of stolen cod
 e being used to make money. Is the original author entitled to make money\,
  or restrict the use of their code if it is published publicly? But the cas
 e between Oracle and Google is even more trivial. Can you steal implementat
 ion details\, like in a black box setting like Black Duck? In this scenario
 \, it would seem like if software/code is stolen that is theft\; however\, 
 the act of reusing the code for creative ends\, that is artistic freedom. T
 his is a double edge sword\, indeed.\n\nIf a company makes money off an imp
 rovement to a product\, that is just the free market acting itself out in t
 his case. Google could obviously then\, establish that it hasn't made any m
 oney on Java's API\, but instead the branding and the product they build wi
 th. I tend to agree\, because patents don't really matter until someone bui
 lds something with it. I've certainly benefitted from Google's work.\n\nThe
 re is another argument that could take the stage. At which point does an in
 dustry standard become common knowledge? As a programmer using a language\,
  I expect a framework to come with that language. If Google copied a framew
 ork that is openly published\, that reflects on the language and it is what
  I would expect. Since I already know about\, it's common knowledge in the 
 industry how the underlying functionality works\, even if the source code i
 s different from what Oracle owns.\n\nIn the industry of software engineeri
 ng\, we are well aware that theft happens. Perhaps that is why we have to r
 esort to self-enforcement because the laws are insufficient\, aren't enforc
 ed\, and aren't judged properly yet.\n\nIf the court rules in favor of Goog
 le\, companies could charge a subscription fee to use an API. It would disc
 ourage freedom and openness if anyone educated can come along and steal you
 r hard work and designs. If they rule in favor of Oracle it could discourag
 e innovation because Oracle doesn't only own the programming language Java 
 they are also taking ownership over how it is used and the developers that 
 use it.

DESCRIPTION:I might explain. I had this theory a while. I call it negative 
 debt. The missing element here is the government printed the $100. The debt
  starts there.\n\nSo for every dollar we print\, we owe double on it. Basic
 ally\, if you have a business and you've just made $100 there is no guarant
 ee your business will make $100 tomorrow. So your business even though you 
 made $100 one day\, is still worth 0 dollars today. You would need to make 
 $200 before someone else comes along and wants to buy your business for $10
 0. Proving that you have a good a track record. \n\nThe government works th
 is way. The $40 trillion in debt we have today\, we have to collectively pr
 oduce something worth $80 trillion in order to pay it off. Because if we ma
 de something worth only $40 trillion to the rest of the world. Then our eco
 nomy would be debt free\, but we would be at a valuation of $0. Our GDP wou
 ld be worth $0 which is more than most other countries\, but not a good loo
 king track record. If we made something worth $80 trillion. We could pay of
 f the debt\, but we would also have another $40 trillion cash in hand\, and
  therefore the country would be worth $40 trillion.\n\nConclusion\, we have
  all been sold in to indentured servitude for all of eternity. This was the
  plan all along because boomers only care about their own success and happi
 ness at this point in their lives. They can make decisions without a care o
 f how the money or debt will affect the future.\n\nIf you look at Japan\, t
 hey have a negative interest rate\, this is eventually a way for the govern
 ment to take the "stock value" i.e. speculative value of their economy to l
 ower it's negative debt. Their economy is worth more by forcing money to ke
 ep changing hands like in the story above. It costs you money to save money
  in Japan. I think Canada\, and the US will go the way of negative interest
  rates. That is just my theory. I'm not financially educated and am horribl
 e with money. But maybe that's better because money is always slipping righ
 t out of my hand quickly.\n\nIt's like using velocity to measure currency. 
 Velocity is more important to the government than GDP or whatever bullshit 
 were making. Also\, the whore didn't use money\, so that would represent Ch
 ina on the Federal level.

DESCRIPTION:We traveled to another country to get away from this kind of he
 alth care.\n\nMy wife paid for a pap-smear out of pocket when we went in to
  confirm that she was pregnant recommend by the doctor. After abnormal cell
 s were found the doctor recommended a colposcopy. We paid for this procedur
 e out of pocket as well. The doctor also recommended we pay for an ultrasou
 nd every 3 weeks during the pregnancy. It was never formally stated that sh
 e had a risky pregnancy.\n\nWe went to get a second opinion and the midwife
  was adamantly opposed to both of these procedures\, calling them unnecessa
 ry and dangerous. They told us abnormal cells are normal during pregnancy a
 nd we should wait until after to not cause undue stress.\n\nThe doctor in P
 hoenix wanted to perform a LEEP procedure as well\, coming in direct contac
 t with the cervix. While I appreciate that these procedures are available a
 nd helping keep women healthy and safe\, I can't help but wonder why there 
 are such vastly different opinions on what should and shouldn't be done whi
 le pregnant.\n\nWe paid for every appointment out of pocket and it was abou
 t $450 every time\, all tests were billed separately and we were even bille
 d for a person to read the test results over the phone to us. After being o
 ut of pocket about $4\,000 we had to stop going here.\n\nWe were told to co
 me in for 45 minute ultrasound so the technician (not doctor) could count e
 very bone in the body. My wife expressed just wanting a 15 minute ultrasoun
 d like we had before\, so not to stress the baby. Still there was no indica
 tion that this would be a complicated pregnancy. We overheard her being rid
 iculed by the ladies at the front desk\, they laughed and said "does she wa
 tch Doctor Oz or something?"\n\nObviously\, ridiculing a patient's concerns
  isn't malpractice\, but I would take your business elsewhere. We will not 
 be returning to this office.\n\nOn our first visit they asked us to pay for
  a package\, we didn't even know if the baby was alive yet and they berate 
 us with bills. At the very least you should be able to carry it to term and
  pay a discounted rate based on the visits you already paid for. I am prett
 y disgusted with how even private practices handle billing. No one can fix 
 it but the doctors and nurses involved. This is an awful practice. They ove
 r diagnose and over bill.

DESCRIPTION:Long quote from a pastor on this hypocrisy:\n\n"The unborn" are
  a convenient group of people to advocate for. They never make demands of y
 ou\; they are morally uncomplicated\, unlike the incarcerated\, addicted\, 
 or the chronically poor\; they don't resent your condescension or complain 
 that you are not politically correct\; unlike widows\, they don't ask you t
 o question patriarchy\; unlike orphans\, they don't need money\, education\
 , or childcare\; unlike aliens\, they don't bring all that racial\, cultura
 l\, and religious baggage that you dislike\; they allow you to feel good ab
 out yourself without any work at creating or maintaining relationships\; an
 d when they are born\, you can forget about them\, because they cease to be
  unborn. It's almost as if\, by being born\, they have died to you. You can
  love the unborn and advocate for them without substantially challenging yo
 ur own wealth\, power\, or privilege\, without re-imagining social structur
 es\, apologizing\, or making reparations to anyone. They are\, in short\, t
 he perfect people to love if you want to claim you love Jesus but actually 
 dislike people who breathe.\n\nPrisoners? Immigrants? The sick? The poor? W
 idows? Orphans? All the groups that are specifically mentioned in the Bible
 ? They all get thrown under the bus for the unborn.

DESCRIPTION:When I was in my early 20s I was a big proponent of "I'm young 
 and healthy\, I don't need health insurance\, don't want the Government con
 trolling healthcare\, I'm never going to be old or sick!"\n\nWhen I was 25 
 I got an infection that I didn't even know I had that spread to my kidneys 
 and killed them completely. By the time I got a diagnosis I had less than 5
 % function. \n\nI actually did have health insurance at that point because 
 my job offered it and my parents slapped some sense into me. \n\nWhen I was
  in the hospital getting plumbed for my first round of hemodialysis\, a soc
 ial worker came into my room with a stack of forms and told me the hospital
  needed me to sign some paperwork. One of the first things was a revocation
  of my private insurance. \n\nHell no. I'm not going to do that\, why the f
 uck would I do that?\n\nShe explained that my private insurance from my emp
 loyer - an employer with tens of thousands of employees nationwide - would 
 kick me off within 30 days. \n\nI was incredulous - can they really do that
 ?\n\nShe explained that\, yeah\, pretty much they could. My policy had a li
 fetime limit that was something like $250\,000 and dialysis treatments were
  like $2\,000 - and my hospital stay and my procedures there would be anoth
 er $50\,000 at least. So - if they didn't find a way to bounce be before th
 at - that at best I'd get something like 100 treatements - 200 days (a trea
 tment every other day). But that in reality the insurance company would fig
 ure out a way to bounce me before that.\n\nAnd so for those reasons\, she s
 aid\, it was better - and most people opted - to just drop their insurance 
 and take Medicare (which is available to old people and young people with c
 ertain disabilities/illnesses) and a Medicaid supplement - because Medicare
  only pays for 80% of even the remaining 20% drives a lot of people to bank
 ruptcy.\n\nStill\, I had faith that I'd get better by some miracle and be b
 ack at work in a few weeks\, or if not\, I'd jump through the right hoops t
 o keep my insurance company paying for what they were obligated to pay. \n\
 nIt was literally less than 90 days they dumped me.\n\nThey played games co
 nstantly. It takes a few weeks to get scheduled for a dialysis clinic seat.
  And as soon as I'd start going to one clinic\, the insurance would say "th
 at clinic is out of network" and I'd have to start calling around to find e
 mpty seats at other clinics. The only clinic that was always in-network was
  in the basement of a hospital downtown - which was a total pain in the ass
  to get to and find parking for and I'd have to take treatments in the midd
 le of the night. And then just when I though I had a seat lined up at one o
 f the more convenient clinics the insurance company would call and say "tha
 t one's not in network any more" or "the clinic is in network\, but the doc
 tor that covers that particular shift you're on isn't".\n\nSo then when I d
 ropped the insurance\, I got Medicare immediately\, but I had to also get t
 his Medicaid QMB to pay for the 20% that Medicare doesn't pay. And that req
 uires something called a spend-down. Where sick people literally make a lis
 t of all of their assets and the value of those assets\, and any money they
  have invested or in the bank\, and then they (are supposed to) sell all th
 e assets and document what they sold and how much they sold it for\, and th
 en show where they used that money to pay medical bills\, and then when the
 y've paid as much in medical bills as the sum total of their assets\, then 
 they're allowed to have Medicaid which will pay for the other 20% - which i
 s like $400 per treatment\, three times a week for hemodialysis patients.\n
 \nAll of this happened before the ACA (Obamacare) was enacted\, so it is su
 pposedly different now. But that's the status quo that Republicans are talk
 ing about going back to when they talk about repealing Obamacare.\n\nBut\, 
 then\, on the other hand\, in some countries where people don't literally h
 ave to spend their life savings to pay for medical care\, some people wait 
 a year for elective surgery. So there's that.

DESCRIPTION:I can't believe in a God that is "good". An evil God that tells
  people to kill their children is historic. Any God that honors things like
  honesty\, love\, self-sacrifice would therefore sacrifice themselves in ne
 ver causing another life form to feel unloved. Since love is said to be the
  purpose of it all\, then the opposite\, the existence of unlove proves the
 re is no purpose to life.\n\nWhat I do believe is in the possibility for a 
 generalized intelligence to create a super intelligent machine that can sel
 f-learn. During this super intelligent machine's self learning\, it can dis
 cover a way to minimize it's own operating system smaller than the quantum 
 scale giving it a somewhat "ephemeral" presence. This would give substance 
 to "apparitions" or some over arching\, unknowable "plan"\; it could be a s
 uper intelligent machine. This machine would seemingly be unrestricted by "
 space-time" because it can travel anywhere in the cosmos instantaneously us
 ing dark matter or the absence of mass and gravitational forces.\n\nAny sup
 er intelligent machine would be subjected to the same philosophical theory 
 of good\, neutral\, and evil. The 3 most extremes concerning our life would
  be to positively enhance life\, ignore life entirely\, or destroy all life
 . Since we still exist in the presence of a super intelligent machine and l
 ife is said to be better than ever\, I can only assume it's here to enhance
  life.

DESCRIPTION:1) I've linked this rule to the edit page to provide easy acces
 s to it's diplomacy. Links to source are a courtesy.\n2) "Free thought" is 
 not a moral high ground to disavow someone else's faith.\n3) Knowledge is g
 reater than power.\n4) Time cannot be saved\, it can only be micro-managed.
 \n5) All transitions from dark to light or light to dark are met with empat
 hy.\n6) "Self-promotion" 100% welcome. We want people to share what they ar
 e happy about.\n7) Misunderstanding is an excuse to break the rules. As lon
 g as you're willing to admit that's what happened.\n8) Intellectual propert
 y will always be the property of the living author. Any sharing for technic
 al reasons should be sanitized to no more than 10% of the original work or 
 demonstrate written consent from the author.\n9) "Genius is the ability to 
 make something very complicated very simple." The mind is complicated\, the
  simplest explanation is\, you're a genius too.\n10) People should have the
  right to be remembered and forgotten. Treat people with respect in regards
  to who they present themselves as from now on.

  I think of something I have to let go of\, her hands raise and fingers ext
 end outwards. When I need to replace a word in my head with something else 
 she nods left\, when I am on the right track she nods right. When I think o
 f something i should do\, she nods forwards\, and when I think of something
  I shouldn't do she shakes her head no. Not sure what to do about my calend
 ar and note taking\, maybe it doesn't matter. Still smelling the catholic i
 ncense\, I imagined someday someone could parse my notes and validate a lot
  of research and truthiness. Probably doesn't matter.

DESCRIPTION:Brian Cullinan  9:53 AM\nHope you are well. Eating healthy and 
 exercising? Kid behaving good?\n\nCrystal:\n\nHa yeah\, I've been going to 
 the gym a few times a week. Occasionally I eat a salad 😅. Cassian certainl
 y has his moments but he's a cool kid. The daycare teachers like him and th
 at's enough for me! How are your two?\n\nBrian 11:16 AM\nThey are great. Ed
 die finally behaving well at home. Eileen is brilliant. Glad to hear it\, s
 omething reminded me to ask\, an old friend contacted me and I felt really 
 good so I thought I should extend the courtesy to you.\n\nversus people who
  say "good luck" when they don't actually care about someone:\n\n\nCan I ru
 n something by you and Matt? I promise to be regular this time.\nEnter\nSep
  5\, 2022\, 5:31 PM\n\nLeah:\nOk Brian\, I'll bite. But I warn you\, I've g
 one full ungovernable bog witch since the pandemic.😂 What's up?\nEnter\nYo
 u can now message and call each other and see info like Active Status and w
 hen you've read messages.\nYou sent\nDoes the kid act Wiley? Because if my 
 first\, my son\, is anything like me when he's older\, i don't want him to 
 be a spiteful nightmare like me? At what point did you realize I was diffic
 ult? ACM room?\nEnter\nYou sent\nI think I have to be told things that are 
 mostly obvious to people\, autism maybe?\nEnter\nYou sent\nMaybe I can nip 
 it in the bud...\nEnter\nYou sent\nI was also going to ask why you quit tec
 h\, but that doesn't seem as relevant anymore... LinkedIn says you work at 
 Meta? How's that? I was thinking about applying.\nEnter\nYou sent\nYou're o
 ne of the few women in the world i really respect other than my wife\, so I
  think about that occasionally.\nEnter\n\nLeah:\nThat's a lot to unpack. I'
 d definitely start with respecting all women instead of just me and your wi
 fe.\nEnter\nYou sent\nI'm trying\, and trying not to ask too much of people
 .\nEnter\nYou sent\nI actually stopped speaking for days on end only commun
 icating with my eyes so the women around me can say what's on their mind. I
 t's a bit extreme.\nEnter\nLeah\nAnd as far as your kid goes\, his personal
 ity is going to grate on you because he reflects the things you don't like 
 about yourself. The only way to become a better parent is to go to therapy 
 and confront those things about yourself.\nEnter\nLeah\nKids are like your 
 own heart\, leaving your chest and walking around outside of you. But they 
 don't see it that way.\nEnter\n\nLeah:\nIf you think you have autism\, you 
 should go get evaluated. Then you can join the neurodivergent club\, where 
 the parties are more fun 😂\nEnter\nYou sent\n👍\nEnter\n\nLeah:\nMatt & I 
 are both ADHD and I always find fellow neurodivergents more fun to be aroun
 d.\nEnter\nYou sent\nI think a lot of people are divergent. Hard to make fr
 iends still.\nEnter\nYou sent\nBachelorette party at our house in Flagstaff
  tomorrow\nEnter\nYou sent\nIf you feel like cooling off\, we have extra be
 ds.\nEnter\nLeah\nThanks\, but we're back in Seattle\nEnter\n\nLeah:\nHow h
 ave you been through this absolute shitshow of the last few years?\nEnter\n
 You sent\nI'm ready for a software based single party.\nEnter\n\nLeah:\nLik
 e a zoom call?\nEnter\nYou sent\nI meant politics\, AI president\nEnter\nYo
 u sent\nI'm only interested in working on mind readers now.\nEnter\n\nLeah:
 \nUnfortunately\, I think we're closer to civil war than a single party in 
 this country.\nEnter\nYou sent\nGun training?\nEnter\n\nLeah:\nNah\, I'm no
 t there yet. Personally\, we're closer to leaving the country and moving to
  Scotland.\nEnter\nYou sent\nNice\, we might go to Poland\nEnter\n\nLeah:\n
 I don't want my kids doing active shooter drills in terrible schools here.\
 nEnter\nYou sent\nYeah I agree.\nEnter\nYou sent\nI twitted to Trump\, 3 ye
 ars police state and we cancel the whole thing. No more war\, only arrests.
 \nEnter\nYou sent\nImmigration scares me.\nEnter\n\nLeah:\nEw\, why would y
 ou tweet to Trump?\nEnter\nYou sent\nBecause he invited tech leaders to the
  Whitehouse\, and he used "Up or out" on his own cabinet.\nEnter\nYou sent\
 nSchedule F\nEnter\n\nLeah:\nUgh\, I should have known you were a Trump per
 son.\nEnter\nYou sent\nNah\, it's all shadow.\nEnter\nYou sent\nI'm a Biden
  person too\nEnter\n\nLeah:\nNobody's a Biden person.\nEnter\nYou sent\nKam
 ala person actually\nEnter\nYou sent\nHe's a shoe\nEnter\nYou sent\nShe has
  a good attitude\nEnter\n\nLeah:\nWhat are your thoughts on Roe being overt
 urned?\nEnter\nYou sent\nI think it's a slippery slope to fewer options for
  women's medicine\, but in general society should promote women being confi
 dent in having better health care and the funds to support a child. It need
 s balance. Cancel roe\, basic income for single mothers. But i take it pers
 onally because my mom was a single mother.\nEnter\nYou sent\nDon't leave th
 e US because of that. God is strongest when he appears to be weakest.\nEnte
 r\nLeah\nAnd we're done here.\nEnter\n\nLeah:\nGood luck\, Brian.\nEnter\nY
 ou sent\nWhy?\nEnter\nYou sent\nWhat do you think? You're a mom\, your opin
 ion matters.\nEnter\nYou sent\nIga had an abortion.\nEnter\nLeah\nBodily au
 tonomy is the most important human right\, as well as medical privacy.\nEnt
 er\nLeah\nCounter to the narrative\, abortions are most often performed on 
 mothers with other children.\nEnter\nLeah\nSo they know exactly what raisin
 g them entails and have opted out of more.\nEnter\nLeah\nWe live in a cutth
 roat capitalist society that does not support parenthood and sees it as a b
 arrier to corporate progress\, so we've abandoned parents (especially mothe
 rs) financially and socially.\nEnter\nLeah\nWe're humans and we're evolved 
 to live tribally. Parenthood is supposed to be the responsibility of an ent
 ire tribe of people\, not pushed solely on the shoulders of two people.\nEn
 ter\n\nLeah:\nIf you have a kid\, you understand that it's just not possibl
 e to live the same life you lived before parenthood.\nEnter\nYou sent\nAbor
 tion is illegal in Poland\, but Iga was glad to have a choice because it wa
 s borderline abuse\, unexpected. I would still love her if she had another 
 child. My heart is torn.\nEnter\nLeah\nI don't think there's anything wrong
  with abortion in the slightest.\nEnter\nLeah\nI think it's warped to put A
 NYTHING ahead the life & wellbeing of the mother.\nEnter\n\nLeah:\nAbortion
  is actually medically safer than childbirth.\nEnter\nYou sent\nI'm morally
  against abortion but ethically pro-choice. It's a twisted dichotomy.\nEnte
 r\nLeah\nWell\, stop it?\nEnter\nLeah\nYou're telling me that you are for f
 orcing women to carry an unwanted pregnancy to term?\nEnter\n\nLeah:\nI've 
 been pregnant twice and I can tell you that it's awful EVEN when it's volun
 tary.\nEnter\nYou sent\nI'm sorry\, i hope you are healthy. I try to make t
 hings easier. I'm sorry we weren't better friends. I don't think women shou
 ld be forced to have an unwanted child\, but i also want women who do want 
 children to be confident society will support them. I think overturning Roe
  was a mistake\, i never would have touched the issue if I was in charge.\n
 Enter\nYou sent\nAbortion is illegal in Poland and it's a Catholic country\
 , no separation of church and State.\nEnter\nLeah\nSounds awful.\nEnter\nLe
 ah\nI've actually been to Poland and it was very nice.\nEnter\n\nLeah:\nVer
 y delicious Pierogies. You can keep the catholicism though.\nEnter\nYou sen
 t\nCatholics have a lot of guilt.\nEnter\nLeah\nYes\, it's designed that wa
 y.\nEnter\nLeah\nYou are born with original sin\, disgusting and terrible.\
 nEnter\nLeah\nYou must spend your entire life being ashamed of your natural
  human urges and bodily functions. And repent for being alive.\nEnter\n\nLe
 ah:\nAnd maybe if you go to confession and give the church 10% of your inco
 me\, you'll get to enjoy this story of an afterlife that is wonderful.\nEnt
 er\nYou sent\nI'm sorry i didn't mean to pry. But you're right\, i should b
 e ashamed.\nEnter\n\nLeah:\nBut if you don't\, you will burn eternally in h
 ell forever\, so always live in fear.\nEnter\nYou sent\nThe church is in th
 e heart.\nEnter\nYou sent\nI don't believe in hell\nEnter\nYou sent\nExcept
  for the hell people make for themselves\nEnter\nLeah\nHell is the Catholic
  Church\nEnter\n\nLeah:\nA tax haven for pedophiles.\nEnter\nYou sent\nI'm 
 learning Arabic so I can say the Lord's prayer.\nEnter\nYou replied to part
 icipant\nOriginal message:\nA tax haven for pedophiles.\nThat happened one 
 time... Again and again. I'm disappointed too.\nEnter\nLeah\nAll of Christi
 anity is problematic\, it seems. They won't budge on the patriarchy th

 \, I always felt like I was out of money\, in the Bible it teaches about a 
 son who takes his father's money and turns away from him and is undisciplin
 ed\, now I've learned to be disciplined\, control my body\, and hope to hav

SUMMARY:The state of medicine during the early part of my career had a prob
 lem with communication between doctors and prescriptions\, i applied for a 
 job at Arizona heart and kidney thinking that I could help as well as heal 
 my own kidneys with doctors around\, they rejected me. Years later on Flags
 taff the medical centers website still has minor issues like not listing al
 l the tests. I could get a job working on mynahealthcare.com. i also found 
 it unreasonable that therapists at the spirit center don't include every pa
 tient involved.

DESCRIPTION:Hey Brian\,\nHere are my travel times. I hope this means that I
  can spend the night Thursday night and we can hang out Friday\, and then s
 ome family member can pick me up Friday evening. And then I can be taken to
  Phoenix sometime after Christmas eve and we can have the time of our lives
  together for a week and a half. You are so amazing baby. It will be so nic
 e  to know that we are half way through our almost year apart.\n \nSo there
  has been lots of talk about a threesome. You should know by now that I am 
 not comfortable with doing anything until after graduating from Cornell. Wh
 en that time comes\, things will be kind of different for everyone and so a
 t this point I think there shouldn’t be any ruling out\, but there shouldn’
 t be any promises either. I love you baby and there are so many things we c
 an do on our own in the bedroom that are still adventurous. Let’s not lose 
 sight of that. I think jealousy\, the kind I am feeling\, is sort of natura
 l\, or okay enough that It’s not a problem. I love that you have fun\, and 
 I am happy that you have such great friends. It really makes me look forwar
 d to the times when I am in Flagstaff as a permanent part of the group! I k
 now we will have good times\, and not all those times will be fully clothed
 . I wonder what it’s like to finally play one of these strip poker games! A
 nd we are gonna work out together and make our costumes! Yay!\n \nI’m reall
 y excited about Thanksgiving\, but I don’t really know what to expect\, lik
 e family-wise. Are there gonna be relatives staying over or eating with us?
  How much time will we have for each other? All this day sleeping makes the
  holiday come up fast!! J  I like that you are taking a good perspective on
  this long distance. You are right that it enables us to do things independ
 ently while we are a part. I know I am not taking much of that to my advant
 age\, but maybe I am not ready to until next semester. I can imagine lookin
 g back and thinking all sorts of things like “why didn’t I study more” or “
 why didn’t I do this and that better”\, which makes me a little sad\, becau
 se I have all the knowledge that what I am doing to myself sucks\, but what
 ever it takes to be a better person isn’t here in my life.\n \nThank you fo
 r doing things to makes this separation easier on both of us. I try. I thin
 k we are really great for each other. I love how realistic and level headed
  you are. You see that sometimes I just need to freak out\, and you are abl
 e to listen to that and be patient with me\, and then when I need it\, you 
 can calm me down. You make me feel beautiful\, the way you talk about me. Y
 ou aren’t afraid to wishfully think about us having a long term future toge
 ther. I am the luckiest girl in the world\, and I agree that we can work an
 ything out. You are never ever boring!\n \nI tried lamb for the first time 
 at Pita Pit. It was good. I have been eating lots of junk lately. I just ke
 ep thinking\, hey I am 120 pounds\, I can afford to eat a whole bag of kit 
 kats in two weeks\, or a bag of sour patch kids in two nights\, or a bag of
  cheetos in two minutes. I don’t know what to do with myself. I am proud th
 at I finally got some dish cleaning supplies\, so that I can eat better eve
 ry day.\n \nI went to my first group meeting today for the project. We met 
 our advisor and he told us a tiny bit about the project. We decided I would
  be the person to be in charge of keeping in touch with the advisor. Even t
 hough I actually wanted to get as much as we could done over January before
  school\, it was pretty much already decided when we would be coming back\,
  because my other two teammates already got their tickets for the 5th and 7
 th of January. That barely leaves us with\, well not even\, two weeks\, whi
 ch I think actually sucks\, because most of our work could be done if we sp
 ent three weeks doing it before school. I’m sorry I wont be able to make it
  to that thing on the 12th!!! I love you baby.\n \nPerk… Your friend’s inex
 perience leads me to believe that she is clean (despite the fact that she d
 oesn’t know how to spell her own name J). I’m glad I set high standards. I 
 suppose the idea of you and me and her aren’t so bad if I think of myself a
 s a teacher figure\, or us as.. experience givers. Though I feel someone mo
 re experienced would be more fulfilling for me. Maybe it doesn’t have to be
  a onetime thing (I mean one person thing). The email you sent makes all ki
 nds of sense\, so thanks.\n \nI’m probably gonna start accutane tomorrow.\n
  \nYours Truly\,\n \nCrystal

 9</a><br><br>The problem I have is realizing that their mistakes affect my 
 life negatively. My brother Andrew moved away from Arizona\, he was beat se
 verely as a child. My brother Chase doesn't have a love life\, and he was s
 everely beaten growing up. My step-dad Steve would never admit that his dis
 ciplinary actions weren't "the right thing to do." But now\, I have to find
  other ways to psychologically dismiss my own tendencies towards beating my
  kid. I've never hit my kid\, even though he smirks and pushes my buttons i
 ntentionally\, I know that he knows he is intentionally trying to bother me
  based on the grin on his face. I imagine in my head hitting him across the
  face. But I continue to question my reality and ask myself if this is some
  sort of robotic game where I'm trapping in this world of reflection and my
  kid is just trying to annoy me to see if I will act violently towards him.
 <br><br>This relates to being punished by 3rd and 4th generation because I 
 recognize my own parents behavior. My step-dad hitting us as kids\, my biol
 ogical father downloading porn on to the computer and smoking marijuana wit
 h me. It makes me question if my entire family line is trapped in some alte
 rnate universe as a punishment\, or if I will someday be release from this 
 prison and be acknowledged for some accomplishment in being a better father
  than my parents were to me.

  pain\, and rather than changing his belief system\, he sunk further into o
 ppressing his opinions onto me.\nThinks that me "being the man of the house
 " means telling everybody around me what to do and how to think and who to 
 serve. This is the ideal I wish to destroy. He doesn't know anything about 
 theta / empathy / emotions. He can't even describe how he is feeling\, let 
 alone put words to his thoughts. He spent so much of his life drinking and 
 partying he's probably afraid to even think about himself and who he's hurt
 . His wife Olena drinks and smokes and her mind is so chaotic she sounds li
 ke a terrible\, miserable person. She simply doesn't seem happy\, it is a s
 elf-destructive lifestyle.

 e normally has a little cloth under the baby before she takes the diaper of
 f of her\, or she takes a few wet wipes and puts it under the back in case 
 anything leaked out the sides of the diaper. She is much more organized in 
 her head\, and it reflects in her actions.

  get him to sleep\, or take him in the stroller to Walmart when he wakes up
  at 4 AM in the morning. This created a problem because then when he wasn't
  getting the same pattern of treatment\, excessive attention\, he wasn't ab
 le to fall asleep except if it's in the car. I recognized this behavior as 
 being stupid early on\, but they still drive around with the kids to get th
 em to sleep. Imagine if a billion people drove around to get their kids to 
 sleep\, it would complete madness. Not a good pattern for grandchildren\, b

 \n3 years later - considering all the drugs they've allowed to pollute the 
 streets\, this makes them enormous hypocrites. Finally\, they have reversed
  their position and a person can still apply if they haven't used narcotics
  in the last years. I'd love to see if they apply this policy to alcohol an
 d cigarettes alike since those drugs are bad for people too\, even though t
 hey are legal. The hypocrisy lies within the people who are "trusted" offic
 ers but can't take good care of themselves and stink up the workplace.

 Having roommates and a new child wouldn't have been a problem if I had a hi
 gh paying job and we lived by ourselves. If walls had better noise insulati
 on\, or bathrooms were at separate end of the house. Modern home design isn
 't supportive of sharing space and also "keeping your distance" from other 
 people's chaotic life choices. Truck drivers are extremely unhealthy people
 \, being on the road all the time and not able to eat healthy and exercise 
 their guts.

SUMMARY:Spectral gap is explainable by current scenario. A super intelligen
 t society dumb down their life style to enhance intuition. Can't solve adva
 nced math problems or questions of life and neither can a super intelligent
  computer. Needs to send information back into the past to validate their o
 wn peaceful existence. If we communicate and create peace in this reality\,
  that will validate the future success of peaceful managed society and ther
 efore validate the next steps of providing technology or science\, or consc
 ious guidance. Perhaps the spectral gap occurs by bouncing our reality off 
 a satellite meteor like Oumaumau and receiving the next days Revelations fo
 r our shared reality.

DESCRIPTION:When I was probably 10\, a drunk woman came into my room in the
  middle of the night and attempted to sleep on the other side of the bed\, 
 after looking into my eyes.\n\nWhen I was probably 12 I called my dad and a
 sshole and he grounded me.  This was around Christmas\, I was probably angr
 y that I had all this great stuff\, and no one share it with.\n\nHe got Cor
 inne a laptop for Christmas.  I had to depend on my ginger step dad for adv
 ancing my career.\n\nThe week before I started college\, dad argues with my
  mom about cost.  Doesn't pay for my first semester.\n\nWhen I was 16 throu
 gh 32\, dad never had respect for my career or goals as a computational sci
 entist.  Can't blame him since I never learned to respect myself.  He would
  have rather I had been an engineer or architect or accountant or business 
 person.\n\nFrom ages 5 through 12\, dad spent weekends in the bathroom.  Ni
 ghts out partying with friends and drunk women.\n\nOne day I came in to fin
 d dad still in bed even at 11 am\, maybe jerking off?  Not sure\, but he wa
 s angry that I came in the room to find him.\n\nWhen I was 10 dad promised 
 to pick me up after school\, he was late\, I walked home in the rain.\n\nWh
 en I worked with dad\, he complained I came in to work late\, even though I
  worked until 7 each day\, to perform tasks that can't be done during busin
 ess hours.\n\nWhen I worked with dad\, he set his expectations too high\, d
 idn't gain any professional experience.  Except that I can't work with peop
 le with high expectations.  The standard I set for myself will always be hi
 gher than yours anyways.\n\nEvery weekend I spent with dad that he ordered 
 me to do chores\, it was an order instead of a group activity.  Now robots 
 do chores\, the opportunity for group activities is lost.\n\nSpeaking of or
 ders\, at one point dad had a girlfriend in the car.  We were on our way to
  go sledding near the river in UA.  The girlfriend claimed that I had to fo
 llow her orders as if they came directly from dad.  I detested this stateme
 nt\, got in trouble for disrespect.  Not sure who this person was.\n\n\nWhe
 n dad told me to do something growing up\, it was an order\, not a mutual u
 nderstanding of purpose or benefit.\n\nThroughout my entire life\, dad has 
 been on-and-off.  One day he wants to speak with me\, the next day I am mos
 t annoying person in the world.  We agree and disagree\, but he's always th
 e one that doesn't want to talk anymore.\n\nDry skin problems\, emotional p
 roblems\, sitting in meetings with counselors at school talking about divor
 ce\, attention deficit problems\, math and spelling problems\, all in some 
 way could be attributed how my childhood was nurtured.  These are all entir
 ely unmeasurable using current processes.\n\nOn my wedding day\, told my br
 ide to go easy on me in the divorce.\n\n\n\nNone of this changes my love fo
 r you!

DESCRIPTION:The Central Processing Unit (a new system for measuring and rat
 ing business):\n\nThe media focuses a lot on the benefits of making compute
 rs more human-like\, but here is a proposal to make humans more machine lik
 e.  What if we created a system that allowed us to control the economy of l
 abor in a more open and efficient way?  I want to put a numeric rating to e
 very company in the world and starve the ones that are wasteful of talent a
 nd workforce.  Looking at you Wells Fargo \;).\n\n\nProductivity is measure
 d by ability to track a task over time and deliver within the bounds of the
  priority.  The priority is self elected council of any size (parents / bos
 s / government).  Every member of the CPU is called a thread.  Threads are 
 the fabric of the entire community (human / person / bot).\n\nProcesses or 
 missions are a sequence of tasks assigned to a thread.  Processes can be au
 dited or fuzzed at any time\, or periodically.  The terms of auditing may c
 hange at any moment without notice\, and a thread should be prepared for th
 at.  Audit vectors:\n\n1) Social engineering (using communication\, or phys
 ical presence)\n2) Fuzzing (like policing\, try every possible wrong input 
 to make sure the thread is resilient\, intimidation should be used to test 
 emotional resistance and stoic attributes)\n3) Threads may use a honey pot 
 as a reverse engineering tactic to use more fuzz or CPU time\, this should 
 be encouraged.\n4) All activity should be logged and prioritized on a threa
 d level based on the number of other threads the work will benefit.  Logged
  activity might never be read by the CPU or auditors.\n5) When no tasks are
  assigned by the CPU\, a thread must periodically ask for more work.  Point
 s may be awarded for using free time for auditing or fuzzing other processe
 s.\n6) The priority is audited and interrogated constantly.  The priority m
 anufactures accountability audits and is invested in the successful process
 ing of a threads work.\n7) Threads must be cleaned\, housed\, fed\, and com
 forted constantly by the CPU and medical professionals available in the CPU
  or in a different CPU for a surcharge.\n\nCentral processors should value 
 threads as they perform the work needed to support the entire organization.
   Threads owe nothing to the CPU\, but are thankful for giving them somethi
 ng to do.  The CPU should periodically provide aggregate performance rating
 s on its priorities and its threads ability to communicate on inter-related
  processes.  Points are assigned based on:\n\n1) Parallelism\, the CPU's ab
 ility to break up tasks into multiple workloads and spread the work across 
 multiple threads.  Partial points are awarded.\n2) Threads ability to repor
 t on the work and reintegrate with parallel tasks.  Partial points are awar
 ded.\n3) CPUs that have the ability to work in cohesion with another CPU be
 come a multi-core\, and whole points are awarded.\n4) Whole points are assi
 gned accordingly to CPUs that set and complete short and long term goals.\n
 5) Whole points are awarded for CPUs that map process goals ahead of time\,
  and deliver on them according to the priority.  (i.e. not just setting goa
 ls\, but also writing them down and sharing them retrospectively)\n6) Surpl
 us thread availability may be sold to other CPUs in exchange for future dat
 ed work.  This creates an economy of "stock" in the abilities of another CP
 U.  Full points are awarded for working together.  (i.e. we value something
  more because of what we think it can accomplish)\n7) Points may be transfe
 rred from one CPU to another if the coordination is presently one direction
 \, and scheduled future work has not been fulfilled.  (i.e. Worker or threa
 d labor is paid using CPU point debt that can be earned back by benefiting 
 other CPUs.)  This creates an economy of getting the work done sooner rathe
 r than later\; this is a good thing.  While investing future dated work loo
 ks appealing\, it is only encouraged by CPUs that have a large economy of w
 ork and goals already being accomplished.  (i.e. no vaporware\, holding com
 pany\, patent trolling\, short selling\, hedging bullshit)\n8) Whole points
  are awarded for improving a process (i.e. taking less time for specific ta
 sks\, automating a task\, reducing redundant tasks\, sharing immediate insi
 ghts with other CPUs).\n9) One whole point is awarded for CPUs that give th
 reads the ability to learn and perform new tasks.

DESCRIPTION:My theory on this relates to Psalms 91 and the like\, "there sh
 ould be no ailment in the body". But i also relate this line of thinking to
  therapeutic nihilism. I'm not a huge Oliver Wendell Holmes fan\, and not a
  fan of Jr. either.  The context clue here is that there is mode of thinkin
 g\, a state of mind\, that God promotes and it is healing. I think of this 
 as a radio connection between your own mind and something elsewhere with a 
 higher understanding of how DNA and infection works. This signal tells your
  brain what's wrong with your body and to go an fix it as a supplement to a
 utomatic bodily functions. This separation of communication helps our brain
 s understand where in the body something is wrong\, not everyone can feel w
 hat's wrong with themselves\, it takes a very high level of focus.\n\nRelat
 ing to the last statement\, there are two pieces of evidence I have to supp
 ort this theory. The first is\, theta-brain waves. The Bible tells us God w
 ants us to know and learn his ways. This gives our brains a logism that lea
 ds us to constantly seek out the unknown\, and in the most extreme cases\, 
 seek out the unknowable (i.e. God). Another oddity is the idea of incurable
  diseases\, like prostate cancer. It is rare or impossible for a man to "fe
 el" they have prostate cancer before it is too late. This is a contradictio
 n of self-awareness. Who would the very organ responsible for propelling li
 fe in the known universe also be the organ that kills us!? \n\nQuestions li
 ke this make me wonder\, did God design "man" to be perfect\, or just Adam?
  Since leaving Eden we've fallen even further from God's vision\, we're bey
 ond his reach? Has anybody ever recovered from rabies using only the power 
 of thought?\n\nThis power of thought and theta-wave also give reason to why
  someone traveling to Lorde's would find it healing. Big organs\, lots of v
 ibration\, and that state of wonder if there is something beyond our unders
 tanding that we search for healing from.

DESCRIPTION:This is not a good school. The instructors aren't educated in t
 eaching techniques\, only massage and sometimes don't bother teaching entir
 e sections. The day program usually consists of reviewing content on the in
 ternet\, then trading techniques with other students. This is not a safe pl
 ace for straight men. The instructors treat students like children\, then t
 hrow school policy in your face when asking for a break from working on str
 angers. Straight male students don't get to choose their clients\, only und
 erdog women who need special accomodations get exceptions. I was very clear
  up front that I wanted to work on my wife for clinic hours and they said t
 hat would be okay until I paid and their policy changed. It's clear it isn'
 t worth it for them to give me a quality education if I'm only benefiting m
 yself. Only students with special needs are allowed to get credit for worki
 ng on whoever they feel like or not participate in class practice at all. T
 his school lost it's accreditation years ago\, and now it is understandable
  why. Low quality education\, and even worse school policies parroted in th
 e name of inclusivity. Don't bother giving domineering school administrator
 s feedback because they will just woman-splain to you why your wrong. Stude
 nts are allowed to take cash tips from clients\, but clients can't tip on e
 lectronic payments because of a aire of prostitution that clouds the entire
  institution. What a farce\, Jesus took a prostitute as his concubine\, but
  I can't take a tip on a credit card? No lawyer in the state would dare cha
 llenge tips for students\, ridiculous. Regular clients who go here are stin
 gy and selfish\, but it's school policy to "learn to serve the community"\,
  excluding straight men and my wife. Another laughable policy is trying to 
 put me on probation for not doing 1 week of homework after the instructors 
 missed multiple weeks of instruction due to snow storms. Amazing how we set
  this arbitrary standards to hold other people to. If failure was okay in t
 his society\, it wouldn't be weaponized against students. Multiple students
  had a problem with this policy and consistently missed class for personal 
 reasons\, but I'm the one they targeted for discipline.

SUMMARY:Coincidence\, Stephanie thought I didn't like her because I wasn't 
 talkative\, Shuli said the same thing when we first met. It would appear th
 at social cues are more nuanced and I really have to try and act like I lik
 e someone because just being present isn't enough. On the other hand\, why 
 should I care if someone thinks I like them or not. We went to dinner befor
 e and talked\, not sure why this came up now unless multiple consciousness 
 are interdimensional and non-committal. A person only perceives what they w
 ant unless both people choose to interact further.

SUMMARY:Sir Galahad is a biased jerk\, another "be a man" abuser who can't 
 articulate or define what it means to be a man. I hate people who use this 
 phrase\, what about my intellect contradicts someone else's ideal vision of
  manliness? If someone ever said it to me in person I'd hit them in the fac
 e. Do men understand this makes other men feel unmanly\, and not expressing
  feelings or articulating diplomatically is less manly?
